REVERENT_DESC=This hero shows deep respect for life and can be revived.

HOLY_BEAST_DESC=Beast mode! Feel the divine energy of the beasts flow into you, making you strong enough to take on the mightiest of attacks.
MALE_DESC=By the power of this tag, this hero is identified as "male". Yup, this hero is definitely male. Yes, he must be.
FEMALE_DESC=By the power of this tag, this hero is identified as "female". Now march forth, heroine!
PROJECTILE_DESC=Up, up and away! Yes, this is a long range weapon and it fires from a far range. Mind the birds!

LAMB_LOVER_DESC=Oh. Doesn't a Goat count as a Lamb? Well... They do look similar, in a way!

BOAST_OF_HEAD_DESC=Heroes with this tag are intelligent, high-risk takers, an epitome of "coolness" with a chest swell with pride. Their favourite response line, "because my life is dope, and I do dope things", is all that is needed to send any of their hecklers scurrying away.
ROAMING_THINGS_IN_THE_DARK_NIGHT_DESC=Roaming heroes in the night. They prefer the dark than the light.
I_LOVE_THE_SEA_DESC=The badass surfers challenge the big wave with full of confidence, but there are some great waves that even heroes are no match for. Although the sea can be intense and harsh, those surfers know that it can be wide and kind, so they try the waves again and again.
HARVEST_PARTY_DESC=Enjoys growing plants while covered in dirt. The plant's sprouts and bears fruits.
