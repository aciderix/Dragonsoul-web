QUEST_0_1=No matter how much I refute, everyone still thinks I'm cute!
QUEST_0_2=It appears that we both have problems, but perhaps we can assist each other. 'Cuteness' is not something I'm known for. I could give you advice on how to induce real terror.
QUEST_0_3=Tell me quick, boney king, how can I be more menacing?
QUEST_0_4=I'm currently on the outs with Drathor, the Dragon Titan. If I give you some pointers, can you put in a good word for me?
QUEST_0_5=If you help me frighten them all, I'll give the Dragon Titan a call.
QUEST_0_6=Capital! The first thing you must do is be more mysterious. Do not hang about all the time. Pop up from the shadows with a loud "Boo!" and cute will be the last thing people will call you.
QUEST_0_7=To fill their hearts with jumps and frights, I'll disappear for six days and nights.
QUEST_0_8=Excessive, but you have fun.

QUEST_1_1=How do you fare?
QUEST_1_2=This is really starting to bug me. Everyone missed me and tried to hug me.
QUEST_1_3=Tosh. Very well, new strategy. Do not hide- rather, make your savagery known. The next time you go off on one of those little Expeditions, tear everything you see to giblets.
QUEST_1_4=A real monster is what I'll be. You should come along and see!
QUEST_1_5=Oh dear me, no. I hate long journeys. They wear my footbones down to absolute nubs.

QUEST_2_1=The change I've noticed is profound- I think they're starting to come around!
QUEST_2_2=Splendid. Drathor will have to warm up to me now: in addition to all my other fine qualities, I even give assistance to adorable little dragons.
QUEST_2_3=I think that you may want to pray- WHAT THE HECK DID YOU JUST SAY?!
QUEST_2_4=Oh drat.
QUEST_2_5=MY CUTENESS PROBLEM ENDS TONIGHT! I'LL SHRED EVERYTHING IN SIGHT!!
QUEST_2_6=Um... well then... problem solved! So glad I could be of assistance. Now, about that call to Drathor- AAAGH!

QUEST_3_1=Want a hug? I'll give you pause, when you see blood dripping from my jaws. Call me cute, that's alright: I'll gobble you up in one big bite!
