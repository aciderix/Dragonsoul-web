QUEST_0_1=Hey Dragon Bro!
QUEST_0_2=What do you neeed, Brozerker?
QUEST_0_3=I need to deck out my bachelor pad. I want to showcase my face on every wall.
QUEST_0_4=Why don't you use those soulstone portraits? If you have about thirty, that would cover your home.
QUEST_0_5=That's a great idea! You're the best, bro!

QUEST_1_1=Whoa! Look at all those handsome faces.
QUEST_1_2=These are going to really tie the rooms together!
QUEST_1_3=Seeing my face everywhere fills me with confidence, Dragon Bro! I bet I can totally KO more baddies in Expedition than you can.
QUEST_1_4=That's absurd.
QUEST_1_5=You want to test it, bro?
QUEST_1_6=I accept your challenge! Thirty hard Expedition fights should be enough to test us!
QUEST_1_7=I'll keep count, bro! I love to count!
QUEST_1_8=You love to-? Fine, you can count. Come on, we have enemies to fight!

QUEST_2_1=Whoa! Which one of us won?
QUEST_2_2=You weren't keeping count?!
QUEST_2_3=Uhhhhh...We both got ten, but then I ran out of fingers.
QUEST_2_4=What?!
QUEST_2_5=You said I couldn't take off my shoes in battle, Dragon Bro!
QUEST_2_6=Unbelievable...I guess we'll have to call it a draw for now.
QUEST_2_7=Woohoo!!! Bro's number one! Bro's number one!
QUEST_2_8=Wait, Brozerker. I've thought of a tie breaker.
QUEST_2_9=Whoa, Dragon Bro! Another challenge? Bring it on!
QUEST_2_10=That Wizard in the Boss Pit is driving me crazy. I think we should take him down a notch.
QUEST_2_11=The heroes that slay together, stay together bro! Let's do it!

QUEST_3_1=Nicely done Brozerker!
QUEST_3_2=Whoa. What do I win, Dragon Bro?
QUEST_3_3=What do you mean, what do you win?
QUEST_3_4=You said it was a tie-breaker!
QUEST_3_5=Oh for the love of- Fine, you win some...self respect!
QUEST_3_6=Woohoo! Dignity! Thanks, Dragon Bro!
