QUEST_0_1=This beach is totally wrecked. I can't believe how gnarly everything looks.

QUEST_0_3=Let's trash these 100 Shiny Bottlecaps for a start.

QUEST_1_1=This place'll look better in no time at all!

QUEST_1_3=He is fully on my bad side right now, he better stay clear.
QUEST_1_4=It'd probably be safer for him if we didn't travel together for a while. I'm thinking 30 hard-mode Expeditions should be long enough for me to cool off.

QUEST_2_1=If I see another can of Hydra-Life again, it will be too soon.
QUEST_2_2=Whew! Beach is finally clean. Now I just need to get people to come back and enjoy it!
QUEST_2_3=I know... doing 1 million water damage will draw a crowd!

QUEST_3_1=Everyone into the pool! I mean the ocean!
