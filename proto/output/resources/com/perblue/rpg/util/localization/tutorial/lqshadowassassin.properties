QUEST_1_2=Next thing she needs ya ta do is sacrifice 5,000 Guild Tokens.
QUEST_1_3=Something about, 'destabilizing Guild Economies to distract such and such'.
QUEST_1_4=I dunno, mate. It sounds important.

QUEST_2_1=Oi! Did you see the news? Apparently, the Earl of Sandwich has been relieved of his duties as leader of the Imperial Guild, and Lady Forier is missing her prized diamond necklace.
QUEST_2_2=Yes, it is amazing how today's elite are constantly losing their prized possessions under their very noses.
QUEST_2_3=Oi! How did the heist go?
QUEST_2_4=I have no idea what you are talking about.
QUEST_2_5=But I do have a purrrrrfect urge to celebrate for some unknown reason.

QUEST_3_3=Shiny!
QUEST_3_4=Don't wear it at the Imperial Salon. Otherwise, feel free to do with it as you wish.
