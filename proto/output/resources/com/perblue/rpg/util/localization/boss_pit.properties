NPC_EVIL_WIZARD_TAGLINE="The Savvy Summoner"
NPC_EVIL_WIZARD_0_DESC=A mad wizard has taken Castle Drake hostage! Strange apparitions can be seen coming from the castle, but they don't look like Umlaut's phantoms.
NPC_EVIL_WIZARD_0_DESC_COMPLETE=The wizard has fled into a nearby room, but the door is blocked by powerful magic. The Understudy may be talented at counter charms, but she's going to work all day to unlock it. Come back tomorrow to battle the Invokus again!
NPC_EVIL_WIZARD_1_DESC=Understudy mutters indecipherably, eyes heavy with fatigue. Suddenly, the lock clicks open. "Nicely done kiddo!" the Centaur exclaims. As the door opens, a bolt of magic dashes out, followed by a maniacal cackling....
NPC_EVIL_WIZARD_1_DESC_COMPLETE=Several of your party members have succumbed to a mysterious gas in the room, and have fallen fast asleep. Electroyeti has managed to discover an antidote in Understudy's journal, but it will take a day to formulate. Come back tomorrow to take on Invokus at full strength!
NPC_EVIL_WIZARD_2_DESC=Your party has fully recovered and followed the blue dusty footprints through the castle. The footprints lead us to an astonishing alchemy lab. It appears that Invokus has been using soulstone dust to create abominations. Time to put an end to this sick pseudoscience!
NPC_EVIL_WIZARD_2_DESC_COMPLETE=Understudy begins to pack up Invokus's alchemy lab: "I'll send this to Magic Dragon for analysis. Perhaps there is something in this madness we can use to our advantage! To her dismay, the table bursts into wild blue flames.\n\n"@#$%! Look out! The flames die down to leave glowing runes on the floor. Understudy records them quickly as they fade away: "I'll get to work on translating these."

NPC_EVIL_WIZARD_0_PIERCING=Invokus's Ghosts are immune to Piercing damage.
NPC_EVIL_WIZARD_0_BASHING=Invokus's Ghosts are immune to Bashing damage.

##### GIANT_PLANT ######
NPC_GIANT_PLANT_TAGLINE="Eater of Heroes"
NPC_GIANT_PLANT_0_DESC=Our scouts have reported rumors of an impossibly large man-eating plant to the north of the Murky Forest. Time to investigate!
NPC_GIANT_PLANT_0_DESC_COMPLETE=The exit has been covered in spiky vines! It will take us several hours to cut a path. We won't be able to catch up with our quarry until tomorrow.
NPC_GIANT_PLANT_1_DESC=We make haste, following the enemy's trail and steadily climbing upward. The ground begins to level off when we finally catch up, trapping the giant plant between us and a precipitous cliff edge.
NPC_GIANT_PLANT_1_DESC_COMPLETE=We make camp for the night, confident that Venusia will wait for us to meet at the cliff base. 
NPC_GIANT_PLANT_2_DESC=We climb down the cliffside, to find our Venusia sitting indignantly in a pile of her own dirt. 
NPC_GIANT_PLANT_2_DESC_COMPLETE=With the giant plant defeated, Understudy starts on her translations right away. We hope that the runes will give us insight into this mysterious hidden Titan.

NPC_GIANT_PLANT_0_TASTY=Venusia can only be lured out of her protective pot by a Tasty hero.
NPC_GIANT_PLANT_1_BASHING=Push Venusia back towards the cliff's edge with Bashing damage or Knockback.

##### GOLD_COLOSSUS ######
NPC_GOLD_COLOSSUS_TAGLINE="The Golden Beacon"
NPC_GOLD_COLOSSUS_0_DESC=The translated runes are instructions for a complicated spell. After several hours, Understudy is able to assemble the ingredients. Our party gathers as she mutters the strange words and suddenly we are transported to a dangerously windy bridge!
NPC_GOLD_COLOSSUS_0_DESC_COMPLETE=Looks like we've got another spell to deal with. The Understudy is going to need some time to gather the ingredients needed for the next teleportation. We might as well get a good night's sleep before our next battle.
NPC_GOLD_COLOSSUS_1_DESC=We prepare to teleport to the Titan's next location. Where will we end up next?
NPC_GOLD_COLOSSUS_1_DESC_COMPLETE=We rest and let Centaur work on our wounds while Understudy looks into a counter-spell and prepares the next teleport. Even with healing magic, we'll need at least a day for our feet to recover.
NPC_GOLD_COLOSSUS_2_DESC=The counter-spell is prepared and we are itching to kick that golden rustbucket's booty. Let's do this!
NPC_GOLD_COLOSSUS_2_DESC_COMPLETE=Aurum turns to stone before our eyes. A secret door opens in the treasure room, revealing one of the Draconian Statues. We have to stop Umlaut before this happens to more Titans! In the meantime, we should continue to investigate and find the remaining statues.

NPC_GOLD_COLOSSUS_0_HEAVY=The strong winds on this bridge won't affect Heavy heroes as much.
NPC_GOLD_COLOSSUS_1_RANGED=The spiky terrain causes damage to your heroes as they walk. Heroes with Ranged attacks will fare best.
NPC_GOLD_COLOSSUS_2_PIERCING=Aurum's Golden Shield can only be damaged by Piercing damage.
