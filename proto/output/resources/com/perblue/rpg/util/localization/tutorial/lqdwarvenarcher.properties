QUEST_0_1=I can see it like a burning tower in the sky... Dwarfhalla! To reach it, I must defeat the mightiest beast in the land, or die trying. Preferably both!
QUEST_0_2=First, I must make an offering to the gods. Only one thing will do: Mjölnirby, the Hammer of Power!
QUEST_0_3=Unfortunately it's been lost for generations. All that's left are fan-made reproductions. Not nearly as powerful as the real deal so I'll have to stack them up. Six of them should do it.
QUEST_0_4=Quantity over quality - the motto of the gods!
QUEST_0_5=The time has come. My hunt for the monster begins!
QUEST_0_6=Need any help, fwiend?
QUEST_0_7=THERE IT IS!!
QUEST_0_8=Agh! Thewe WHAT is?! Is it ON ME?!!

QUEST_1_1=I must reach Dwarfhalla. It's my destiny!
QUEST_1_2=I feel like this quest is self-destwuctive. It's vewy wowwying- wo- it's vewy vexing.
QUEST_1_3=Self-destructive! Exactly! The gates of Dwarfhalla will only open when my blood is mingled with yours, foul creature!
QUEST_1_4='Foul' is a vewy mean thing to call someone. *sniff*
QUEST_1_5=The time of my apocalyptic conquest has come! Heaven will shake with the might of... of... are you crying?!

QUEST_2_1=Look, it was a simple mistake. It turns out the beast I was hunting was one of Umlaut's phantoms. So I'm going to die in battle with someone else. Does that make you feel any better?
QUEST_2_2=Much! Do you have evewything you need?
QUEST_2_3=Let's see... crossbow, bolts, battleaxe, sunscreen... oh, I need my Lifting Belt. "She hoisted the corpse of her slain foe over her head and got a hernia" doesn't make for the most compelling epic poem.
QUEST_2_4=I'd still wead it.
QUEST_2_5=Thanks. Alright, the time has almost come. Gods, give me the strength to destroy the mighty beast! I mean, not this one, the other one!
QUEST_2_6=But you still think I'm mighty, wight?
QUEST_2_7=*sigh* Yes, you're very mighty. Now onward, to BATTLE!

QUEST_3_1=In Dwarfhalla, the feasts are endless and the maidens pour mead over your head. I just realized that's pretty much every Saturday night for me.
