QUEST_0_1=Like, wow....
QUEST_0_2=I was thinking about XP Potion.
QUEST_0_3=You know if you jumble the letters, it spells Pop Toxin?
QUEST_0_4=I don't want to put anything toxic into my body, man.
QUEST_0_5=Let's destroy 1,000 potions in protest!

QUEST_1_1=Groovy Druid, why on earth did you destroy all those potions?!
QUEST_1_2=Like, they're totally toxic, man.
QUEST_1_3=There's nothing toxic about them! They are completely natural.
QUEST_1_4=Wow....really?
QUEST_1_5=Yes! It's going to take us forever to get that many again!
QUEST_1_6=Hey, chill....I'll make it up to you. I'll earn gold by fighting in the Expedition.
QUEST_1_7=Fine. Thirty fights on hard should do it.
QUEST_1_8=Totally. I'll earn back that dough in no time! But leave Brozerker at home, he's a total buzzkill.

QUEST_2_1=I've got to give credit where it is due, you did a great job.
QUEST_2_2=Totally.
QUEST_2_3=How's your hedgehog handling all this battle time?
QUEST_2_4=Like, this is child's play for him, man.
QUEST_2_5=What an impressive little guy.
QUEST_2_6=Yeah, totally. I'm sure he could still take on another 90 baddies today.
QUEST_2_7=No way!
QUEST_2_8=Way. I'll totally prove it.

QUEST_3_1=That hedgehog's dynamite!
