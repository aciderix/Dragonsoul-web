LEVEL_2_PRE_1=Hey! Don't you remember us?
LEVEL_2_PRE_2=@$#!
LEVEL_2_PRE_3=Does that mean yes or no?
LEVEL_2_PRE_4=No idea, but he's coming this way! Zoiks!

LEVEL_4_PRE_1=Velcome to Castle Dracul. So nice of you to join me for dinner...
LEVEL_4_PRE_2=I don't think that's Umlaut.
LEVEL_4_PRE_3=Umlaut shall live forever! All hail the great dragon Umlaut!
LEVEL_4_PRE_4=I think he's being controlled too! This isn't good...

LEVEL_8_PRE_1=What the...how can you be over there when I'm here?!
LEVEL_8_PRE_2=Umlaut holds your Power! All hail mighty Umlaut!

LEVEL_8_POST_1=That was weird. I don't like fighting myself.
LEVEL_8_POST_2=Hmm... I don't think that was you. It looked like a phantom version of you. Do you think Umlaut made these phantoms?
LEVEL_8_POST_3=That makes sense. I wonder if I can become stronger by defeating them.
LEVEL_8_POST_4=I bet the Soulstones have something to do with this. Let's continue to investigate.

LEVEL_19_POST_1=Vhat is going on?
LEVEL_19_POST_2=You were under the control of an evil dragon!
LEVEL_19_POST_3=Yes, yes, now I remember. He said vonce he controlled all of ze dragons, he vould bring zis vorld to ruin!
LEVEL_19_POST_4=Uh, I think I understood that. And it doesn't sound good.
LEVEL_19_POST_5=You must free ze other dragons! Before it's too late!
LEVEL_19_POST_6=Vill you come with us? I mean, will you come with us?
LEVEL_19_POST_7=Until you have my Soulstones, I can't guarantee your safety. He could take over at any time! Collect ze Stones, and I will join you!

LEVEL_26_PRE_1=Hssssss
LEVEL_26_PRE_2=So you're the little pyro that's been causing all this ruckus.
LEVEL_26_PRE_3=Hssss! Who are you calling littlesss?
LEVEL_26_PRE_4=He's getting ready to charge! Steel yourselves!

LEVEL_29_POST_1=Wait a second... do you have any idea where we are?
LEVEL_29_POST_2=No clue. I'm a city girl. All these plants look the same to me.
LEVEL_29_POST_3=%#&@!!! We're lost, aren't we?

LEVEL_32_POST_1=Hsss! Retreat!
LEVEL_32_POST_2=Hey, come back here! I'm not done with you yet!
LEVEL_32_POST_3=If we head back up the hill, we should be able to see above the treeline. We can figure out where we are and see where the Dust Devil is headed.

LEVEL_36_POST_1=Whoa, look at those ruins up ahead! I've never seen pre-Draconian architecture intact like that.
LEVEL_36_POST_2=Heheh. Nerd.
LEVEL_36_POST_3=Whatever, Miss 'Optimal Temperatures for Quenching when Forging Weapons'.
LEVEL_36_POST_4=You're both @#$% nerds. Are we goin' to #@%#$% sizzle somethin' or what?

LEVEL_38_POST_1=Hsss...who are you?
LEVEL_38_POST_2=It's alright, we're friends.
LEVEL_38_POST_3=What happened to me? It'sss all blanksss...
LEVEL_38_POST_4=You were being controlled by Umlaut.
LEVEL_38_POST_5=Yesss, now I remember sssomething about that. He said, "Once all the dragonsss are mine, everyone will fear Umlaut Andragonissst the Fifth."
LEVEL_38_POST_6=...Did you say, Umlaut... the Fifth...?
LEVEL_38_POST_7=Yessss
LEVEL_38_POST_8=BWAHAHAHAHA!!
LEVEL_38_POST_9=You are complete and utter children, you know that?
LEVEL_38_POST_10=BWAHHAHA... I'm ha ha... sorry, I just can't ha ha... help myself!
LEVEL_38_POST_11=You mussst sssave the other dragonsss!
LEVEL_38_POST_12=OK, you're right. This is no laughing matter.
LEVEL_38_POST_13=Don't worry little pyro, we'll save your buddies.
LEVEL_38_POST_14=If you can sssave my Soulstonesss, I will join you. Until then, I'm going somewhere lessss flammable. Or iss it inflammable?

LEVEL_42_PRE_1=Let's (hic) raise a glass to Umlaut!
LEVEL_42_PRE_2=Time to crash this party! You're going to pay for trashing this place!

LEVEL_45_PRE_1=This fort belongs to Umlaut!
LEVEL_45_PRE_2=Not if I have anything to do with it!
LEVEL_45_PRE_3=RAAWWRRR!!!

LEVEL_51_POST_1=RAAWWRR! Fall back! We have to protect the treasure!
LEVEL_51_POST_2=Did I hear someone say, 'treasure'?

LEVEL_57_POST_1=Whoa, what happened?
LEVEL_57_POST_2=You were under the control of an evil dragon.
LEVEL_57_POST_3=He sent me here to take this Fort...RAWWWR! What have I done?
LEVEL_57_POST_4=It wasn't your fault! We'll use the treasure to repair what's been destroyed.
LEVEL_57_POST_5=What?!?
LEVEL_57_POST_6=Makes sense strategically, and it's the ethically correct thing to do.
LEVEL_57_POST_7=Blondie my dear, you are a royal pain in the...
LEVEL_57_POST_8=I'm going somewhere where I'm not a risk to anyone. Find my Stones soon and I won't have this hanging over my head!

LEVEL_61_PRE_1=This is my old home! I can't believe what's happened to it...
LEVEL_61_PRE_2=How far is the Elven Realm from here?
LEVEL_61_PRE_3=Not too far, although I've never been there. They don't take kindly to visitors.

LEVEL_64_PRE_1=ARGH! You've entered the controlled territory of Umlaut! Prepare to DIE!
LEVEL_64_PRE_2=Snakes! Why did it have to be snakes?
LEVEL_64_PRE_3=You'll pay for what you've done to this valley! Heeyah!

LEVEL_70_POST_1=The Elven Realm will soon be ours! Smash them!
LEVEL_70_POST_2=Thundering #@%$! They're headin' straight for the Dragonfly Forest!
LEVEL_70_POST_3=We have to stop them! I won't let them destroy someone else's home the way they have mine!

LEVEL_76_POST_1=ARGH! Where am I?
LEVEL_76_POST_2=You're in Hydra Valley.
LEVEL_76_POST_3=NO, no! It can't be! This is a wasteland.
LEVEL_76_POST_4=Yeah, and you and your friends are the cause.
LEVEL_76_POST_5=It's not their fault...
LEVEL_76_POST_6=I don't care! They've destroyed my home!
LEVEL_76_POST_7=ARGH. This was my ancestors' home too! Collect my Stones and I'll make sure this never happens to anyone again.
LEVEL_76_POST_8=Fine! Find someplace where you can't do any more damage and stay there until we collect your Stones!

LEVEL_80_PRE_1=Horde SMASH!!
LEVEL_80_PRE_2=Those statues are original Bling Dynasty! We have to stop them!!

LEVEL_83_PRE_1=Rainbows? Mer?
LEVEL_83_PRE_2=Omigosh. I want one. Can I keep it, please?
LEVEL_83_PRE_3=Grrrrr.
LEVEL_83_PRE_4=She's under Umlaut's control! Hold fast friends!

LEVEL_90_PRE_1=Grrr...Poison their water source! This forest will belong to Umlaut! Sparkle power!
LEVEL_90_PRE_2=Whoa. When good dragons go bad, they really go bad!
LEVEL_90_PRE_3=@$%! She's comin' this way!

LEVEL_95_POST_1=Mer? Wuh-what happened?
LEVEL_95_POST_2=Oh good, looks like she's snapping out of it...
LEVEL_95_POST_3=Grrr...Umlaut tried to make me destroy the very place I've sworn to protect!
LEVEL_95_POST_4=You still are at risk until we collect your Stones. You should stay away from here until then.
LEVEL_95_POST_5=Glitterglows! Thank you for freeing me! Once it is safe, I will join you on your quest!!!
LEVEL_95_POST_6=Woohoo!
LEVEL_95_POST_7=Grrr...I am not your pet.
LEVEL_95_POST_8=Aww...fine. Just be safe until you can join us, ok?

LEVEL_99_POST_1=Do you see that? A massive group of monsters is heading East.
LEVEL_99_POST_2=This is uncharted territory, not sure where they're heading to.
LEVEL_99_POST_3=Well, let's follow them and find out!

LEVEL_105_PRE_1=Ugh...I'm so hungry!
LEVEL_105_PRE_2=If we can surprise them here and clear them out, we can rest and cook our food.
LEVEL_105_PRE_3=Let's %$@% do this, then!

LEVEL_108_POST_1=There's a tower in the distance. The monsters all seem to be heading for it.
LEVEL_108_POST_2=Might be important. Mark it on our map.

LEVEL_114_POST_1=The tower's  up ahead. What could be in there?
LEVEL_114_POST_2=Come on! Less talkin', more movin'!
LEVEL_114_POST_3=Keep your pants on, Fuzzball.
LEVEL_114_POST_4=Centaur, the Electroyeti doesn't wear pants.
LEVEL_114_POST_5=Blondie, your flair for the literal never ceases to amaze me.

LEVEL_117_PRE_1=Wait a @#$&# second. We were just here!
LEVEL_117_PRE_2=I think this tower has been enchanted with the Labyrinthus Charm.
LEVEL_117_PRE_3=Can you dispel it?
LEVEL_117_PRE_4=I could try, but without the right spellbook we'd probably end up upside down or worse.

LEVEL_118_PRE_1=Well, at least it's not that &*#$%@ entryway.
LEVEL_118_PRE_2=Omigosh, omigosh, omigosh! Look at all the books!!!
LEVEL_118_PRE_3=We don't have time for this, kiddo.
LEVEL_118_PRE_4=Hrmph. Alright, I'll just... borrow a few for the road.
LEVEL_118_PRE_5=Understudy! You put those back this instant! You have no idea where those books have been!
LEVEL_118_PRE_6=FIIIIIIINE.

LEVEL_124_PRE_1=Uh, guys? This looks a lot like the lab I was trained in.
LEVEL_124_PRE_2=ARRGH! This tower belongs to the mighty Umlaut!
LEVEL_124_PRE_3=What have you done with my teacher?!
LEVEL_124_PRE_4=Look out!

LEVEL_130_PRE_1=Quickly, set everything ablaze! Ve can't let zese magical texts get into ze enemy hands!
LEVEL_130_PRE_2=Ay, ay, sir!
LEVEL_130_PRE_3=What are you doing?! These books are invaluable!
LEVEL_130_PRE_4=Only Umlaut deserves this power!
LEVEL_130_PRE_5=Come on! If we hurry, we can still save the library.

LEVEL_133_POST_1=Mer! You'll never see your mentor again! He belongs to Umlaut now!
LEVEL_133_POST_2=Wait, what the $%@#? You mean you've kidnapped him?
LEVEL_133_POST_3=Oh no!
LEVEL_133_POST_4=We'll have to stay hot on her heels and find out where they've taken him. Chin up, kiddo.

LEVEL_137_PRE_1=There you are! I was so worried. Are you okay? 
LEVEL_137_PRE_2=All hail the powerful Umlaut!
LEVEL_137_PRE_3=No! It can't be!
LEVEL_137_PRE_4= He's coming this way, get ready!

LEVEL_143_PRE_1=Fools! You'll never get your mentor back. He belongs to Umlaut the Great!
LEVEL_143_PRE_2=Screw you, bonehead.
LEVEL_143_PRE_3=Understudy! Language!
LEVEL_143_PRE_4=HAHAHAH- @#&*! Look out!

LEVEL_152_PRE_1=Hey! I've got a bone to pick with you!
LEVEL_152_PRE_2=Your mentor is already far from here! Only I know where he's gone!
LEVEL_152_PRE_3=I'll loosen your tongue!

LEVEL_152_POST_1=Quickly, to the Underground Ruins!
LEVEL_152_POST_2=Retreat!!!
LEVEL_152_POST_3=She's the only one who knows where my teacher is! Don't let her get away!

LEVEL_158_PRE_1=GAH! The fiends have found us!
LEVEL_158_PRE_2=You didn't think I would give up that easily, did you?
LEVEL_158_PRE_3=Monsters! Attack!

LEVEL_162_PRE_1=Quickly, gather everything you can! Meanwhile, I'll look for the artifact!
LEVEL_162_PRE_2=Ay, ay, sir!
LEVEL_162_PRE_3=These artifacts belong in a museum, not with Umlaut!
LEVEL_162_PRE_4=Stall them! It's imperative that I find the statue.

LEVEL_168_POST_1=Where am I? What's going on?
LEVEL_168_POST_2=You were being controlled by Umlaut!
LEVEL_168_POST_3=Wait, I vaguely remember- the statue! You can't let Umlaut have it!
LEVEL_168_POST_4=Wasn't planning on it.
LEVEL_168_POST_5=If he gets all three of the Draconian Acolyte Statues, he can begin the ritual! You have to stop him!
LEVEL_168_POST_6=So we have to free dragons, AND nab statues? This is becomin' @#%$ ridiculous.
LEVEL_168_POST_7=No kidding. Why these ancient races left their artifacts of unimaginable power just lying around is beyond me.
LEVEL_168_POST_8=I'm getting out of here before I do more damage. Collect my stones, and it should be safe for me to join your team. So long for now!

LEVEL_171_POST_1=GAH! What's happening? Understudy, is that you?
LEVEL_171_POST_2=It's good to see you, sir!
LEVEL_171_POST_3=I can't believe I was so easily controlled! This statue, we have to protect it!
LEVEL_171_POST_4=We'll take it to Fort Tannin for safe keeping.
LEVEL_171_POST_5=Thank you. I'm going to lock myself in my tower until you collect my stones.
LEVEL_171_POST_6=Then you'll join us?
LEVEL_171_POST_7=Of course! I can't be separated from my star pupil for long.
LEVEL_171_POST_8=So, where to next, kiddo?
LEVEL_171_POST_9=What about the Dragon Temple? If you head west, it's deep within Titan Canyon.
LEVEL_171_POST_10=Sounds like a plan. Let's get moving!

LEVEL_178_PRE_1=Who are you, that draws so near? Are you someone I should fear?
LEVEL_178_PRE_2=Awww...aren't you just the cutest?
LEVEL_178_PRE_3=UMLAUT SENT ME TO THIS PLACE, NOW I'M GOING TO RIP OFF YOUR FACE!!!
LEVEL_178_PRE_4=Whoa. Look out!

LEVEL_181_PRE_1=Hey kiddo, get over here! I think I recognize the pictographs on these walls.
LEVEL_181_PRE_2=Hm...Sorry, I'm not familiar with this language.
LEVEL_181_PRE_3=It's ok, I can read it. Hm...something about an ancient power...
LEVEL_181_PRE_4=Wait, you can translate ancient pictographs?
LEVEL_181_PRE_5=Of course. They're usually the only way to crack the puzzles that unlock ancient treasure vaults!
LEVEL_181_PRE_6=Man, I @#$@% hate those things! Why do we always have to jump on platforms or step on floor tiles, just to get loot?!
LEVEL_181_PRE_7=Hopefully the Temple will have more of these. Come on, we're almost there.

LEVEL_184_PRE_1=Zoiks! Look at all these pictographs. The walls are covered!
LEVEL_184_PRE_2=Centaur, can you decipher these?
LEVEL_184_PRE_3=You bet, blondie! Hm...
LEVEL_184_PRE_4=Whoa. Those are some seriously large monsters, bro.
LEVEL_184_PRE_5=Hm...there's something about giant beings...and a world on fire.
LEVEL_184_PRE_6=Are they the same as the giant phantoms we've heard rumors about?
LEVEL_184_PRE_7=I don't think so. These look unique.
LEVEL_184_PRE_8=There you are you silly-heads!
LEVEL_184_PRE_9=TIME FOR YOU TO FALL DOWN DEAD!!!

LEVEL_190_POST_1=Oh my goodness, what a fright! What has happened on this night?
LEVEL_190_POST_2=You were being controlled by an evil dragon. How are feeling now?
LEVEL_190_POST_3=My memory is coming back...Umlaut sent me to attack!
LEVEL_190_POST_4=Can you tell us anything about the pictographs at the temple?
LEVEL_190_POST_5=Phantoms turned to Titans, shadows of giants from times gone by!
LEVEL_190_POST_6=So the giant phantoms are Umlaut's creations? What about the ones depicted in the Temple?
LEVEL_190_POST_7=Combine the statues for the summon key, that is what Umlaut said to me. But now I am far from family and home. Lost and lonely I must roam!
LEVEL_190_POST_8=You're lost? Poor little blue!
LEVEL_190_POST_9=Here, take this map and follow it to my mentor's tower. He'll watch over you until we can get your stones. While we travel, we'll ask around and try to find your family.
LEVEL_190_POST_10=Thank you kindly, my new friends! Umlaut's reign we soon will end!

LEVEL_194_PRE_1=Monster SMASH!!!
LEVEL_194_PRE_2=Woah! I love to smash things too, bro. Finally, a kindred spirit!
LEVEL_194_PRE_3=Kindred? We... friends?!
LEVEL_194_PRE_4=Yeah, totally! Let's be best friends forever dude!
LEVEL_194_PRE_5=Friends...
LEVEL_194_PRE_6=SMASH!!!!
LEVEL_194_PRE_7=Look out, Bro!

LEVEL_197_PRE_1=Wetched Webels! I wun you into the gwound!
LEVEL_197_PRE_2=What have you done with the kidnapped villagers?
LEVEL_197_PRE_3=Umwaut is the wightful wuler of this world! Attack!!!

LEVEL_209_PRE_1=@$#*! We're so high up, I can't even see the @$#%!%@ ground!
LEVEL_209_PRE_2=You ok, Electroyeti?
LEVEL_209_PRE_3=The sooner I can $&*#@ sizzle this dragon, the sooner my feet will be on solid ground. Move your $@*#!
LEVEL_209_POST_1=Oooo my head! My memowy is all foggy...
LEVEL_209_POST_2=You were being controlled by an evil dwag... er.. dragon, bro!
LEVEL_209_POST_3=There are a lot of villagers missing. Do you know anything about that?
LEVEL_209_POST_4=I'm sowwy, but I'm not wesponsible for their disappeawance.
LEVEL_209_POST_5=Do you know anything that might help us find them?
LEVEL_209_POST_6=There are stwange wights coming fwom the top of the mountains. I was pwanning on wooking into it...
LEVEL_209_POST_7=You stay here and rest, we'll investigate!
LEVEL_209_POST_8=Thank you. Once you have cowwected my stones, I will help in any way I can!

LEVEL_232_PRE_2=Oh dear. That was quite a tumble.
LEVEL_232_PRE_3=Oi! This ice is impossible. I can't move an inch without flippin' onto me bum!
LEVEL_232_PRE_4=I bet I can turn your roller skates into ice skates. Just a second....
LEVEL_232_PRE_5=UNDERSTUDY! Why are there roast turkeys on me feet?!!!
LEVEL_232_PRE_6=Oh fluffernutters. That spell didn't go right at all.
LEVEL_232_PRE_7=Fix it right now! Me feet are all warm and...squishy.
LEVEL_232_PRE_8=I guess you'll just have to get used to fighting on the ice.

LEVEL_238_PRE_1=The storm is getting worse!
LEVEL_238_PRE_2=Youuu believe zis is a storm dooo yooouuu?
LEVEL_238_PRE_3=@$%! You're causing this wind, aren't you!

LEVEL_238_POST_4=Brace yourselves! She's causing an avalanche!

LEVEL_241_PRE_1=Whoa, bro. Those are some crazy statues.
LEVEL_241_PRE_2=Those aren't statues! They're the missing townsfolk!
LEVEL_241_PRE_3=Who could do such a thing?
LEVEL_241_PRE_4=Whoooo youuu say?
LEVEL_241_PRE_5=Why you little... This is low, even for Umlaut. You'll pay for this!

LEVEL_241_POST_1=She's getting away!
LEVEL_241_POST_2=Looks like she's headed for the coastline in the far distance.
LEVEL_241_POST_3=Oi! I know that area! Me favorite cousin lives there. We'll need to head west down the mountain.
LEVEL_241_POST_4=I'll send a message to Magic Dragon. I bet he'll be able to help out these townsfolk.
LEVEL_241_POST_5=Well hurry up already! I can't wait until we can get out of this @$#%* snow!

#Chapter 15

LEVEL_267_PRE_1=Skullduggery Port. Now why does that sound so familiar?
LEVEL_267_PRE_2=I have no idea, but I've heard this place has a certain reputation. It's supposed to be pretty dangerous, and you know what they say about danger!
LEVEL_267_PRE_3=Blindly run after it before better judgement takes over?
LEVEL_267_PRE_4=...Sure, that works.

LEVEL_273_PRE_1=Oi! Watch where you're going mate!
LEVEL_273_PRE_2=Yarg! That be "matey" to you! Wait a minute, Roller Viking?
LEVEL_273_PRE_3=Rot Beard is that you? Oi! It is! I knew Skullduggery Port sounded familiar for a reason! How've you been? How's yer mum and all that?
LEVEL_273_PRE_4=Yarg! She be good.

LEVEL_285_PRE_2=Oi, big guy! No one messes with my favorite Cousin's town! Let's Rumble!

LEVEL_285_POST_1=What happened? Oh no! Did I step on anyone?
LEVEL_285_POST_2=You were being controlled by Umlaut! We had to snap you out of it, and you didn't step on anyone that I know of.
LEVEL_285_POST_3=Thank you! I can't believe I was enslaved by Umlaut. That guy is just the worst! I'll help you take him down if you want.
LEVEL_285_POST_4=You're still vulnerable right now, wait till we can find your soulstones and then we'll talk.
LEVEL_285_POST_5=Just give a holler when you have all my soulstones and I'll be ready for action!
 
#Chapter 16
 
LEVEL_286_POST_1=Now that that's done we can focus on finding more soulstones... Wait! Where are all the soulstones!?
LEVEL_286_POST_2=Oh sweetie, did you lose something?
LEVEL_286_POST_3=Who the #$%@ are you lady!?
LEVEL_286_POST_4=I'm a thief, you potty mouth. Thought the outfit would have been a dead giveaway! Anyway, if you want your stones back you'll have to catch me first! Ciao!
LEVEL_286_POST_5=Oh my stars! She's burgled our baubles!
LEVEL_286_POST_6=Errr, yes. That's been established. Now let's #$%@ catch her!

LEVEL_292_PRE_1=Run, run, run as fast as you can! You can't catch me I'm the... Master Thief!
LEVEL_292_PRE_2=Lady, that doesn't even #$%@ rhyme!
LEVEL_292_PRE_3=Haha! Who said it had to, my dear?

LEVEL_304_PRE_1=Son of a kitten, I could swear there are usually more places to hide on a boat.
LEVEL_304_PRE_2=It's a ship, you lowborn cutpurse! Now give us the stones back! We are on an urgent mission to defeat the evil Umlaut!
LEVEL_304_PRE_3=Umlaut?! What do I care about him? Guy sounds like a total pain in the derriere.
LEVEL_304_PRE_4=YOU DARE INSULT UMLAUT!? You shall pay for your insubordination, mortal! I shalt pillage the soulstones from your corpse and present them to Umlaut!!
LEVEL_304_PRE_5=Now now dear, this has all been a big misunderstanding. You know, the stones aren't even mine? And that mousey little witch is the one who was talking trash about your precious Umlaut.
LEVEL_304_PRE_6=You dirty... ROGUE! I hate you!
LEVEL_304_PRE_7=Hate is a strong word sweetie. Your shoes, now THOSE are hateworthy! Here, take your stupid soulstones back. Being killed by an angry, possessed dragon was not on today's agenda. Ta-ta!

LEVEL_304_POST_1=Thank you, tiny mortals, for rescuing me from Umlaut's cold embrace. I carried so much rage within me while under his spell. How can I repay you?
LEVEL_304_POST_2=Stop calling us 'tiny mortals' for a start. It's #$%@ degrading.
LEVEL_304_POST_3=Will you be able to help us defeat Umlaut after we collect your soulstones?
LEVEL_304_POST_4=Usually I do not interfere in earthly matters. But you have displayed such valor and decency, I shall make an exception. It would be my honor to aid you.

#Chapter 17

LEVEL_308_PRE_1=Who's there? I demand you come out and face us.
LEVEL_308_PRE_2=I mean you no harm, I am a guardian of this island. You must leave here, this place is not safe.
LEVEL_308_PRE_3=Our ship crashed here, we literally cannot leave until it's been repaired.
LEVEL_308_PRE_4=I am sorry that your ship has been damaged. Without it, I do not imagine you will survive long here.
LEVEL_308_PRE_5=Wow, you really don't 'beat around the bush', am I right?
LEVEL_308_PRE_6=I do not understand your meaning.
LEVEL_308_PRE_7=You know...because you're a plant.
LEVEL_308_PRE_8=*Groan* Please just stop talking.

LEVEL_311_POST_1=Dude, let's just cut down some trees and use those to fix the ship.
LEVEL_311_POST_2=That's a great @$*#! idea!
LEVEL_311_POST_3=I cannot let you do that, these trees are my charges. I will not let harm come to them.
LEVEL_311_POST_4=@$*#! tree hugger!! You are a downright killjoy, you know that?

LEVEL_323_PRE_1=So there isn't anything on this island that we can do to repair the ship?
LEVEL_323_PRE_2=Everything we could possibly use falls under the ever-growing category of Plant Soul's 'charges'.
LEVEL_323_PRE_3=Wait! What about all the other crashed ships on shore? We could get the supplies we need from there.
LEVEL_323_PRE_4=Omigosh! A patchwork ship would be so cute!
LEVEL_323_PRE_5=No, you cannot do this. That shore is far too dangerous. A great dragon that feasts upon carnage and death lives there.
LEVEL_323_PRE_6=Of course it does.
LEVEL_323_PRE_7=Well, it's a good thing we are in the dragon slaying business. Let's rumble!

LEVEL_323_POST_1=What in the bloody entrails just happened!? My head feels like it imploded.
LEVEL_323_POST_2=You @$*#! attacked us!! Just like everything else on this @$*#!!!@$*#!!!@$*#!!! ISLAND!!!
LEVEL_323_POST_3=Sorry about that, is there any way I could make it up to you? If you need help hiding a body, I'm your Dragon.
LEVEL_323_POST_4=How about instead, you let us ransack the ships that have crashed on your shores? We need to fix our ship in order to get off this island.
LEVEL_323_POST_5=Sure, that works too. Just let me know if you ever needs my 'special' services.
LEVEL_323_POST_6=Ugh, I sure hope we won't.

#Chapter 18

LEVEL_324_POST_1=Oh my stars! A patchwork ship is even more adorable in execution than it is in theory!
LEVEL_324_POST_2=Are you certain you don't mean 'disturbing'?
LEVEL_324_POST_3=Ooh! Ooh! Look at the masthead! It looks like it might be from the Draconic Age! How on earth did it arrive on that island?
LEVEL_324_POST_4=Yes, it's a very nice carved tree. Can we get to the Ship Deck? I want to find a better vantage point in case of enemy attack.
LEVEL_324_POST_5=Fine. But afterward can we please check out the rest of the ship?

LEVEL_333_POST_1=We keep getting transported back to the Prow! What kind of magic could be causing this!?
LEVEL_333_POST_2=Like, I don't mean to be a downer, but it's not magic, man. It's a curse that's causing this.
LEVEL_333_POST_3=What kind of curse could keep bringing us back here?
LEVEL_333_POST_4=It's called, like, a geographic loop. All kinds of curses deal in lost time and trippy transportation. Trust me, I've had, like first hand experience.

LEVEL_339_PRE_1=I think there's someone else down here.
LEVEL_339_PRE_2=Sorry, that would be me.
LEVEL_339_PRE_3=Like, don't mean to be rude or anything. But you're seriously lacking some legs there lady.
LEVEL_339_PRE_4=Omigosh, you're dead.
LEVEL_339_PRE_5=Yes, that would be true. I'm sorry, but I died far from here, on one of the ships you salvaged. Please, may I stay? I don't take up much space.
LEVEL_339_PRE_6=I would say you, like, literally don't take any space at all. You know, being incorporeal and all that.
LEVEL_339_PRE_7=Of course you can stay. We're just having a dickens of a time trying to stop a geographic loop that has us trapped here. Do you know anything that might help us?
LEVEL_339_PRE_8=I've heard other spirits on the ship talking about the curse and a very nice tree but I don't really know what they mean. Sorry, I wish you the best of luck.

LEVEL_342_PRE_1=Banshee said that thing about the very nice tree, right? She was talking about the masthead! I mean it's been glowing this whole time! It's obviously cursed!
LEVEL_342_PRE_2=So what do you propose we do? Attack it and hope something happens?
LEVEL_342_PRE_3=Hey, I can like, try to cast a counter curse or something.
LEVEL_342_PRE_4=Ok...why not. Give it your best shot.
LEVEL_342_PRE_5=Yeah, like, hey man. Being a masthead can't be such a great gig or, you know, being cursed. I mean, why don't you like, stop doing it? Oh, and like, abracadabra...or something.
LEVEL_342_PRE_6=...That was...
LEVEL_342_PRE_7=UUUUUMMMMMLLLAAAUUUUUTTTT!! YOU DESTROYED MY SHIP!! KILLED MY CREW!!! IMPRISONED ME IN A LOG!!!! I'M GOING TO MURDER YOU!!!!
LEVEL_342_PRE_8=Oh no! Sir, we didn't do any of that!!
LEVEL_342_PRE_9=No use in explaining! Let's kick his butt first and give the backstory later!

LEVEL_342_POST_1=Sir? Are you alright? I'm sorry we had to fight you, but we didn't know what else to do.
LEVEL_342_POST_2=No hard feelings little one. I awoke so confused and angry. I've been in that masthead for a long time. Umlaut trapped me there after he killed my crew. I was doomed to drift the ocean until I washed up on that island. From there, well, you know the rest.
LEVEL_342_POST_3=Sorry about your crew. Would you like to join us on our quest to defeat Umlaut? We would love to have you!
LEVEL_342_POST_4=A fine idea! Let me know when you require me!

#chapter 19 release 2.9

LEVEL_343_PRE_1=Oh thank @#&^*! We're off that stinking, awful @&$!$ boat!
LEVEL_343_PRE_2=For the last time, it was a ship!
LEVEL_343_PRE_3=For the last time, I do not @*$%!*$ CARE!!
LEVEL_343_PRE_4=Why isn't anyone here? The port is normally the busiest part of a town.
LEVEL_343_PRE_5=You're right, that is strange...
LEVEL_343_PRE_6=Do *not* say what I think you're gonna say!
LEVEL_343_PRE_7=I bet the town is cursed!
LEVEL_343_PRE_8=OH @!$%&@$&!!!

LEVEL_349_POST_1=Ha HA! At last thou'rt entrapped, sucker!
LEVEL_349_POST_2=What the @!*$&%? Bad touch! Bad touch!
LEVEL_349_POST_3=Release him, or feel the bite of my steel!
LEVEL_349_POST_4=But this fusty swine has brought terror to the fair streets of Bete Noire! Why dost thou defend him?
LEVEL_349_POST_5=I think there's been a big misunderstanding here. The only thing foul about Electroyeti is his mouth.
LEVEL_349_POST_6=Zwounds! Foiled again! I've long sought a mighty horned beastie. I thought by your companion's shadow I had finally netted him.
LEVEL_349_POST_7=Sorry to disappoint you, fella. Now let's figure out this @!$&*$@ curse so we can get out of here.
LEVEL_349_POST_8=Thou seekest an end to the curse as well? I believe that it, and the creature I seek, are connected!
LEVEL_349_POST_9=Really? That's fascinating!
LEVEL_349_POST_10=Sooth! The shadow of the foul creature was seen by locals at the very hour the plague mists rolled in.
LEVEL_349_POST_11=Omigosh! A plague that's also a curse? You have to join us. We must to get to the bottom of this!
LEVEL_349_POST_12=Oh, @&?$!& perfect. Just keep your hands to yourself, pal.
LEVEL_349_POST_13=Verily, sure, sorry.

LEVEL_361_PRE_1=Unclean beast! I have come to punish you for terrorizing the city of Bete Noire! Avaunt and quit my sight!
LEVEL_361_PRE_2=Be gone, fancy man! You and your cape have no place in this cursed city - it belongs to Umlaut now.
LEVEL_361_PRE_3=It is you who have no place here, churrish hedge-pig!
LEVEL_361_PRE_4=No, I say it is you!
LEVEL_361_PRE_5=Ha HA!
LEVEL_361_PRE_6=OH FOR @$%?& SAKE!! CAN WE PLEASE JUST MOVE ON TO THE @!*$% FIGHTING?!
LEVEL_361_PRE_7=Your heads shall make fine trophies for Umlaut. Let us begin!

LEVEL_361_POST_1=Now that you aren't possessed, could you tell us what happened to you?
LEVEL_361_POST_2=I was a just an ordinary, attractive man living here in Bete Noire. One night I was attacked by a Dragon, one cursed by the plague. I fought back valiantly, but he bit me and got away. Soon after I transformed into the exquisite and powerful creature you witnessed. It is sadly a burden I must now bear.
LEVEL_361_POST_3=And then Umlaut possessed you.
LEVEL_361_POST_4=Indeed. I didn't mean to terrorize anyone. I wanted to protect the townsfolk, but every time I tried, I became confused under Umlaut's control. I'm sorry if I insulted you, fancy man.
LEVEL_361_POST_5=Ha HA! No offense taken. Sorry I called you a hedge-pig.
LEVEL_361_POST_6=What will you do now?
LEVEL_361_POST_7=I will protect the townsfolk as I initially intended. Thanks to you, I am free of the dark magic that clouded my judgement.
LEVEL_361_POST_8=We'll find your soul stones and send for you once we have them. I'll do my best to research a cure for you as well.
LEVEL_361_POST_9=Thank you, I wish... Miss, what are you doing? Stop, don't touch that altar!

#chapter 20 release 2.10

LEVEL_362_PRE_1=Sweet buttered toast, where are we?
LEVEL_362_PRE_2=If only we had a competent wizard, we could use magic to find our way.
LEVEL_362_PRE_3=Competent?!? It's your fault we're even here! Okay. That's it. Your days of not being a sentient olive loaf are officially numbered -
LEVEL_362_PRE_4=Quit bickering, you two - we've got creeps inbound!

LEVEL_362_POST_1=Excuse me, can you help us? We have no idea where we are -
LEVEL_362_POST_2=SHHH! Where the heck did you come from? You need to hide before they see you!
LEVEL_362_POST_3=Well that isn't ominous at all.
LEVEL_362_POST_4=I swear by my winter wardrobe, if you don't button up I will zap you. You're the reason we're in this mess!
LEVEL_362_POST_5=You both need to button up! Everyone down here has been possessed by Umlaut. I've been able to evade his goons but you nerds are severely jeopardizing that!
LEVEL_362_POST_6=OH THAT'S JUST @$!#& GREAT!! ARE WE EVER GOING TO END UP SOMEWHERE WHERE FOLKS AREN'T !@^$#&@ POSSESSED AND WE AREN'T IN !#%#$!% DANGER!?!
LEVEL_362_POST_7=Dude! What did I JUST say!?

LEVEL_368_POST_1=How did Umlaut get enough power to possess everyone? He's only been able to do a few people at a time until now.
LEVEL_368_POST_2=It's called the Chaos Nexus. It's an ancient, sacred source of power. We aren't even supposed to touch it. It's guarded day and night by an ancient darkness, but somehow he got control of it, and then got control of everyone else. I'm guessing that's why they implemented the whole "no touching" rule.
LEVEL_368_POST_3=So we need to get to the Chaos Nexus.
LEVEL_368_POST_4=Am I speaking Dwarvish or are you not listening? Ancient! Sacred! No touching!
LEVEL_368_POST_5=I understand your concern, but we have to do something. I can protect us from danger, if Master Thief can find a way to disable the Nexus.
LEVEL_368_POST_6="If"? It's so tiresome when people try to punch up.
LEVEL_368_POST_7=Deep breaths, Understudy. Go to your quiet place.

LEVEL_380_PRE_1=Wild guess here: this is the Chaos Nexus.
LEVEL_380_PRE_2=What gave it away, love? The crackling dark energy or the groaning sound of the fabric of reality being warped?
LEVEL_380_PRE_3=Can we just disable the !@#&* thing? I'm sick of you two @$@$!& bickering all the time.
LEVEL_380_PRE_4=NO! Don't touch the Nexus!!!
LEVEL_380_PRE_5=Miserable insects! Who dares approach the Chaos Nexus?
LEVEL_380_PRE_6=RUN! His power is near-limitless!
LEVEL_380_PRE_7=Puny mortals! When I have finished with you, you will wish that I had only destroyed your bodies! I shall wipe you from the face of existence itself!!

LEVEL_380_POST_1=What goes on here? Who are you?
LEVEL_380_POST_2=We're the good guys. We were trying to stop Umlaut from using the Chaos Nexus.
LEVEL_380_POST_3=I recall a shadowy figure, indomitable and terrifying even to me... after that, nothing. The next thing I remember, was you lot trying to disable the Chaos Nexus.
LEVEL_380_POST_4=What?!
LEVEL_380_POST_5=Hey, "take over" and "disable" can look very similar...
LEVEL_380_POST_6=*sigh* Nevermind. Umlaut hijacked the Nexus and now everyone in this realm is possessed. Can you help us stop him?
LEVEL_380_POST_7=It may take me some time to right what that villain has accomplished, but I have no doubt that I can reverse the effects. Umlaut's trail leads into the Nexus. I will stabilize the portal so that you may pursue him!
LEVEL_380_POST_8=Thank you! We'll find Umlaut and work to gather your soul stones so that you won't get possessed again! 

#Chapter 21 Release 2.13

LEVEL_381_PRE_1=Demons! Return to the oblivion from whence ye came or be annihilated!
LEVEL_381_PRE_2=Demons?! We aren't demons - we are heroes!
LEVEL_381_PRE_3=Liar! Yield now or I shall be forced to treat you as hostile!
LEVEL_381_PRE_4=I shall never yield! You shall taste my steel and my clenched jaw shall be the last thing-
LEVEL_381_PRE_5=We yield! We yield! Apologies, my friend here gets a little hot under the armor when she's told what to do. We came through the Chaos Nexus and are looking for this realm's guardian. We were told he may help us in our quest.
LEVEL_381_PRE_6=If it is help you seek, you must first prove that your cause is righteous through honorable combat!
LEVEL_381_POST_1=You are clearly righteous heroes. However, I must apologize - there is no help to be had here. Umlaut overpowered the guardian and now the entire realm suffers from corruption. It's a fair bet you've experienced it already. Angels are supposed to aid heroes, not attack them.
LEVEL_381_POST_2=That's terrible. Is there anything we can do?
LEVEL_381_POST_3=My soldiers and I are overwhelmed as it is just trying to keep the peace. If you like, I can spare some supplies and point you in the direction of the Holy Spire. Who knows, if you make it that far you might have a chance at defeating our guardian. Sergeant!
LEVEL_381_POST_4=Yes Ma'am!
LEVEL_381_POST_5=See that these folks get outfitted. Oh and sorceress, one more thingâ€¦
LEVEL_381_POST_6=Yes? What is it?
LEVEL_381_POST_7=If you can rescue the Guardian from the powers of darkness, you will have the might of the Angelic Realm at your side. I implore you to save him if you can.
LEVEL_384_POST_1=Who planned this place? How are we supposed to find our way through all these clouds?
LEVEL_384_POST_2=May I be of service, my dear?
LEVEL_384_POST_3=Oh my... cheekbones...
LEVEL_384_POST_4=Goodness, are you alright? Have I caused you any distress? I didn't mean to startle you.
LEVEL_384_POST_5=We...uh...we're looking for the...the
LEVEL_384_POST_6=Just ignore her, that's what I do. We're looking for the Holy Spire.
LEVEL_384_POST_7=The Holy Spire? Yes, of course. You just continue down the Rainbow Roads. Are you certain your friend alright? I think she may be having some sort of fit.
LEVEL_387_PRE_1=Mortals are not welcome here - every fiber of your existence shall be erased!
LEVEL_387_PRE_2=She's terrifying! Let's get out of here!
LEVEL_387_PRE_3=NO! She's being controlled by Umlaut. If we free her she may be able to help us!
LEVEL_390_POST_1=Thank you for freeing me, Heroes.
LEVEL_390_POST_2=Wait, you knew you were being controlled by Umlaut?
LEVEL_390_POST_3=Yes - he used my own powers to entomb my mind. I was aware of everything while it happened, but powerless to act.
LEVEL_390_POST_4=That's everyone! Let's make for the Spire!
LEVEL_393_PRE_1=By my bow! We finally made it to the Holy Spire! Now let's go do what we do best!
LEVEL_399_PRE_1=Is everyone in position? Don't let the enchanted ceiling and sparkling lights distract you!
LEVEL_399_PRE_2=FOR THE ANGELIC REALM!!!
LEVEL_399_PRE_3=Tsk, tsk, tsk. My sweet metal child - you sadden me with your feeble attempts at rebellion. Don't you see the futility of it all? Under Umlaut's control all that doubt, all that dissent, all that anger - it's wiped clean. Why do you fight it? Why won't you just give in?
LEVEL_399_PRE_4=I am here to pass judgement upon you for your crimes against the Angel Realm!
LEVEL_399_PRE_5=Really? We shall see about that. It's too bad you had to drag your new friends into this too. Blood is so hard to get out of grout-work.
LEVEL_399_PRE_6=We will bring you to your senses if it takes the entire heavenly host!
LEVEL_399_POST_1=Oh my children! I am so sorry. All those hurtful things that I said, please know it wasn't me who said them.
LEVEL_399_POST_2=Is it over? Is Umlaut really gone from the Angelic Realm?
LEVEL_399_POST_3=I'm not surprised, actually that's kind of his M.O. But what does that mean for us? For the first time since we started this quest I'm at a complete loss as to where we go from here.
LEVEL_399_POST_4=Really? This is the FIRST time you didn't know what to do next? The ONLY time?
LEVEL_399_POST_5=Oh shush. You know what I mean.
LEVEL_399_POST_6=My child, I can send you and your friends to the Angelic Temple in the Land of Myths. From there, make your way from there to the City of Myths - there you will find the Soul Vault along with many answers if not Umlaut himself.
LEVEL_399_POST_7=Thank you, that may give us the advantage we've so desperately needed.

#Chapter 22 Release 2.14

LEVEL_400_PRE_1=Could we *gag* take a *gag* break from teleporting for a while?
LEVEL_400_PRE_2=Stay here and ruminate for a while. Teleportative magic was not designed with four stomachs in mind.
LEVEL_400_PRE_3=Okay - anybody who isn't a ruminant, let's move out! The Angels said we're a few days out from the City of Mythss.
LEVEL_400_PRE_4=Be still foul creatures and I will ease your unmaking from this world lest your presence further defile this great temple.
LEVEL_400_PRE_5=Who the @$#! are you calling a foul creature, ya geezer?!?
LEVEL_400_PRE_6=Geezer? I am the master of time! I will put your foul language back into your mouth. En garde!
LEVEL_400_POST_1=Stay your blades, heroes - I see you as you are. Forgive me. I am the Eternal Enchanter. I was working to restore this temple to its former glory.
LEVEL_400_POST_2=What happened here? It would have taken incredible power to damage a temple of angels.
LEVEL_400_POST_3=A menacing dragon of legend... three heads spouting fire... claws and teeth that rend stone to dust. A monster with no honor.
LEVEL_400_POST_4=We seek the Soul Vault. We believe it a horrible heist has happened and that we may find a clue there to apprehend the thief.
LEVEL_400_POST_5=The Soul Vault is at the center of the City of Myths! It has been overrun by dark forces for many moons. Those who were not slain now fight on behalf of the darkness.
LEVEL_400_POST_6=Same @$#! different day.
LEVEL_400_POST_7=At least we're getting closer!

LEVEL_403_PRE_1=Neighhhh! Something is stalking us from the tall grass...
LEVEL_403_PRE_2=UL-LU-LU-LU-LU-LU-LU-LU-LU-LU-LU!
LEVEL_403_PRE_3=Look out for her arrows!!!
LEVEL_403_POST_1=Ugh... my head...
LEVEL_403_POST_2=Rest, my friend. These heroes had to wield much of their power against you to restore your senses.
LEVEL_403_POST_3=We ride to take back the City of Myths! Will you join us, Huntress?
LEVEL_403_POST_4=Noble Centaur - our arrows shall rain justice on our foes! UL-LU-LU-LU!
LEVEL_403_POST_5=Ahhh yeah! Bow Buddies!

LEVEL_406_PRE_1=Behold! The City of Myths! In... some... of its glory.
LEVEL_406_PRE_2=Inspiring - the quality of its architecture rivals my own flawless bone structure!
LEVEL_406_PRE_3=...As usual, Centaur, your focus on the superficial misses the most important information. Enchanter - this place - this entire city is overflowing with magical power. If we could harness it, we could all gain tremendous power!
LEVEL_406_PRE_4=You are most perceptive! In fact, the city sits at the meeting of many ley lines - causing vast magical energy to gather here. For ages, mighty heroes such as - WATCH OUT!
LEVEL_406_PRE_5=Slay Heroes!!! For Umlaut!
LEVEL_406_POST_1=Slay... Heroes... Wait... What? No! I am a hero!
LEVEL_406_POST_2=You're not just a hero - are you not the Dragon Slayer of myths?!?
LEVEL_406_POST_3=Haha! I was known as such once - though I feel much of my former power has left me...
LEVEL_406_POST_4=How... How is that possible? You're a hero from ancient times - the founder of the Dragon Knights!
LEVEL_406_POST_5=A story for another time - first we've got some dragons to slay!

LEVEL_412_PRE_1=Hold! Across the square stands the Soul Vault!
LEVEL_412_PRE_2=Prepare yourselves - we must secure the Vault. We can clear Umlaut's forces from the city later!

LEVEL_415_PRE_1=This place is massive! There are enchantments of expanding upon the building - its interior space is not limited by the building's physical structure!
LEVEL_415_PRE_2=MWAHAHA! YES! WE WILL BURN! WE WILL CRUSH! WE WILL SMASH!
LEVEL_415_PRE_3=Of course... my old nemesis! I should have recognized your indiscriminate destructive ways.
LEVEL_415_PRE_4=OUR DESTRUCTIVE POWER IS PALTRY COMPARED TO UMLAUT. SPEAK FOR YOURSELF! MY DESTRUCTIVE POWER IS AN HOMAGE TO UMLAUT! YOU TWO ARE FOOLS - OUR POWER COMES FROM UMLAUT!
LEVEL_415_PRE_5=Shut up and tell us where Umlaut took the Soul Stones!
LEVEL_415_POST_1=YOU CAN NOT STOP UMLAUT - ALL DRAGONS - TO US!

LEVEL_418_PRE_1=You've got to be kidding! This is like a greatest hits collection of everyone I never wanted to see again.
LEVEL_418_PRE_2=Ahahah! I vont to velcome you to the end of your vayfaring!
LEVEL_418_PRE_3=RAAWWRRR!!! Umlaut will reign supreme!
LEVEL_418_PRE_4=AS YOU CAN SEE, UMLAUT CONTROLS THE GREATEST DRAGONS! YOUR JOURNEY ENDS HERE! MWAHAHA!
LEVEL_418_POST_1=I... WE... BLARGH - NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO TOLERATE THREE HEADACHES. THANK YOU, HEROES.
LEVEL_418_POST_2=Stand proud! That Umlaut clung so desperately to you... and our bruises... are proof of your power.
LEVEL_418_POST_3=I know a way you can make it up to us...
LEVEL_418_POST_4=WHAT? TELL US! HOW?
LEVEL_418_POST_5=We're going to keep doing what we've always done - keep fighting until we get to the Dragon!
LEVEL_418_POST_6=There are many of us, and Umlaut will ultimately stand alone against our might!
LEVEL_418_POST_7=ALRIGHT! WE'RE IN! LET'S DO THIS!!!

#Chapter 23 Release 2.15

LEVEL_419_PRE_1=...I mean, I'm pretty sure I read that the catacombs beneath the Soul Vault have another exit!
LEVEL_419_PRE_2=Understudy, you know I love nothing more than cleaning creeps out of catacombs, but you should just admit you're lost.
LEVEL_419_PRE_3=Pardon me, but could we simply follow the sunlight to get out?
LEVEL_419_PRE_4=You're new here, gramps. It's better we stick with her rather than losing her down here. Trust me.
LEVEL_419_PRE_5=Umlaut's great and fair power brings life to the fallen! Ye shall join them!
LEVEL_419_POST_1=This shall be most problematic! The fallen heroes wielded great power!
LEVEL_419_POST_2=If they stand in our way, then we'll beat them and save them!
LEVEL_419_POST_3=You will need a good plan to get through here, but thank you for being good heroes.
LEVEL_422_PRE_1=I don't deserve to serve Umlaut...
LEVEL_422_PRE_2=Hey - that's ok! Join us instead!
LEVEL_422_PRE_3=NO! If I'm in the game, then I get to be a villain!
LEVEL_422_POST_1=Ow... my head. Was I out at Karaoke?
LEVEL_422_POST_2=Take it easy - breaking the fourth wall puts a lot of strain on the brain.
LEVEL_425_POST_1=*COUGH* *COUGH* Where did all this dust and rock come from?
LEVEL_425_POST_2=I think the ceiling just caved in! Wait, I hear something. Who's there?!?
LEVEL_425_POST_3=Oh bro, I was trying to catch up with the team after taking a wrong turn. Sorry bros!
LEVEL_425_POST_4=There were rats, bro. Huge rats.
LEVEL_425_POST_5=R-rats?!? Ah well, good thing I wasn't there... you know... I'd hate to steal your fun! Heh!
LEVEL_428_PRE_1=These catacombs were created by weaving enchantments into the stones themselves - allowing for infinite volume within a finite space!
LEVEL_428_PRE_2=Come on! I knew that! Let me lead the group again! I totally know all about this place!
LEVEL_428_PRE_3=I would prefer not to be lost in here for eternity - you lead the way, old man.
LEVEL_431_PRE_1=Ahhh yesssssss! It sssssmellsssss wonderful in here!
LEVEL_431_PRE_2=Dude - it reeks in here. Like... someone had a campfire inside a karaoke room.
LEVEL_431_PRE_3=Dios mio! Who would do something so horrible to such a holy place?! It makes me want to cry!
LEVEL_431_PRE_4=Ah ke ke ke! I do what I want! Including burning you all to ash! Your tears won't save you here!
LEVEL_431_POST_1=Oh no... please tell me I wasn't dancing on the sarcophagi again...
LEVEL_431_POST_2=Not that we saw, amiga. But you definitely spilt something on that tomb back there.
LEVEL_431_POST_3=Just come with us and let's get out of here... no use crying over spilled... whatever that was.
LEVEL_434_PRE_1=Woah, the bricks are like... floating in the air! Should I smash them out of the way?
LEVEL_434_PRE_2=It would be best if you did not... smash... the magic here is highly volatile.
LEVEL_434_PRE_3=The City of Myth was built atop major soulstone veins - it appears the crystals have grown into the catacombs. We would do well to identify the cause.
LEVEL_437_PRE_1=Go away! I only want to rest in peace!
LEVEL_437_PRE_2=S-Sven?!?
LEVEL_437_PRE_3=Is it really you amigo??? Are you okay???
LEVEL_437_PRE_4=I know what you came for - to save me and to go into the caves beyond here.
LEVEL_437_PRE_5=Si - that's right! You can come with too! We're going to help these heroes!
LEVEL_437_PRE_6=I helped and created for so long... I just want to rest or... destroy!
LEVEL_437_PRE_7=I'll make you a deal - if you can face your DOOOOOOOM and survive, I will lend you what remains of my power.
LEVEL_437_POST_1=Uff da! You guys sure do pack a punch! I am so proud of all of you. You've had quite the journey!
LEVEL_437_POST_2=Thanks, Sven!
LEVEL_437_POST_3=My friends, I am not Sven. Not truly. I am the Shadow of Sven - left with a mere fraction of my former power.
LEVEL_437_POST_4=Even so - it is an honor to meet you! Will you join us?
LEVEL_437_POST_5=Join you? You may be powerful enough to beat my minions but... no... not yet. You all didn't use all of your power.
LEVEL_437_POST_6=Huh?! You mean we are stronger than this?
LEVEL_437_POST_7=Show it to me! I need to see it. I will wait for you in the realm beyond the caves. Be ready... I won't be easy to defeat.
LEVEL_437_POST_8=Hey Sve... errr...Shadow of Sven! Where are you going... 
LEVEL_437_POST_9=HUH?! What about the caves!? A realm?! Wha... SVEN!! Oh... he is gone... and he is strong. We all need to be prepared.

#Chapter 24 Release 2.16.0
LEVEL_438_PRE_1=Sveeeen! Are you here? Hellooo!!
LEVEL_438_PRE_2=This cavern never seems to end.
LEVEL_438_PRE_3=Sven. Finally. Listen we just want to...
LEVEL_438_PRE_4=You keep calling me by a name that I know not. Tell me why I shouldn't kill you now?
LEVEL_438_PRE_5=Sorry, Shadow. SHADOW of Sven. Jeesh! He seems to have gone darker.
LEVEL_438_PRE_6=Hey, Sven. You don't seem to be yourself. Are you ok?
LEVEL_438_PRE_7=The time is drawing near. I can feel my power growing as well as your own. What say you?!
LEVEL_438_PRE_8=HUH?! What do you mean?! We just want to ta..
LEVEL_438_PRE_8=@#$%! Stop what you are @#$%^&# doing and just listen, Sveeeeeeen!
LEVEL_438_PRE_9=I am Shadow of Sven. I GIVE ORDERS, NOT OBEY THEM! RARGH!!
LEVEL_438_POST_1=*heaving breaths* I don't understand.  Why did you attack us?
LEVEL_438_POST_2=You all intrigue me. There is so much that you don't know.
LEVEL_438_POST_3=Shadow of Sven. Come on. We are like brothers. Come back to Sojourner Sorceress and I.
LEVEL_438_POST_4=I need... more... time. I'll see you at the Fortress beyond the falls. Be ready.
LEVEL_438_POST_5=What's wrong with this guy?
LEVEL_438_POST_6=I don't know. I'm sure there is something he isn't telling us.
LEVEL_438_POST_7=Never mind. For now, let's focus on getting out of this cavern. I believe he went that way so let's follow.
LEVEL_441_PRE_1=... I can't believe it. I mean, my fathers have told me about it but I cannot still believe it!
LEVEL_441_PRE_2=Wha... What is it? What is this place?!
LEVEL_441_PRE_3=... Behold. This is the Lost Realm of $%@^!
LEVEL_441_PRE_4=*gasp* Understudy! This is no time for jokes!
LEVEL_441_PRE_5=No no. That's the actual name of this place.
LEVEL_441_PRE_6=And I thought I was bad.
LEVEL_441_PRE_7=You don't understand. Here supposed to be a beautiful haven, rich and prestigious with life!
LEVEL_441_PRE_8=Then why does it reek of death...?
LEVEL_441_PRE_9=No. It can't be. Your kind supposed to be the perfect gentlemen, compassionate, honorable. What happened?!
LEVEL_441_PRE_10="All thou hast come to thee wilt feel the wrath of he."
LEVEL_441_PRE_11=The %$@!?
LEVEL_441_PRE_12=That is what engraved on the stone over there. Near perfect analogy of this miserable place compared to my homeland.
LEVEL_441_PRE_13=Why did you do this? Why did you lead me here?
LEVEL_441_PRE_14=A friend of yours?
LEVEL_441_PRE_15=We've never met nor seen him befo...
LEVEL_441_PRE_16=SHUT YOUR PIE HOLE AND BURN! Deceiverrrs!!
LEVEL_441_POST_1=I am sincerely and incredibly sorry. I don't know what came over me.
LEVEL_441_POST_2=We all let our temper get the better of us, young man.
LEVEL_441_POST_3=Who are you? We have never met you before.
LEVEL_441_POST_4=It's great that we finally got your attention. Listen, we...
LEVEL_441_POST_5=Wait! That way! I'm sure of it.
LEVEL_441_POST_6=If you want to see the beach you need to head upwards in that direc... HEY!?!
LEVEL_441_POST_7=Salty but sweet, great sun & heat, must be paradise for meee!~ It sounds like bliss from the scholars' lips, must be paradise for meee!~ Lalaa lalaa!!~ *fade*
LEVEL_441_POST_8=Understudy? That scary path that idiot is walking to. Do you know where it leads?
LEVEL_441_POST_9=If I remember childhood stories correctly, that area should be the Lost Souls of @#$^ ... Death.
LEVEL_441_POST_10=Everyone, wait. "Tho bones may break, and nerves cry out in pain. My heart may ache, but compassion will maintain. -Anonymous"
LEVEL_441_POST_11=If I understand the position of this stone and the words engraved on it, *points* that should be the path we must take.
LEVEL_441_POST_12=Anonymous... Isn't that the legendary warrior who transformed his powers into an incredible gauntlet before he passed away?
LEVEL_441_POST_13=Yes. Anonymous' "Gauntlet of Anonymous" supposed to be legendary. Created to protect the innocent. Bless him.
LEVEL_441_POST_14=Then we'll look for this gauntlet. Heroes! Let's push onwards and keep our eyes open for the gauntlet!
LEVEL_444_POST_1=WHO GOES THERE? We see yah, yaaaass.
LEVEL_444_POST_2=Understudy. Who are these two strange beings?
LEVEL_444_POST_3=I have never heard nor seen them before.
LEVEL_444_POST_4=We bosh, we bish, we will knock out ya teeth. Yardy hardy, rock rock bish!
LEVEL_444_POST_5=We do not follow...
LEVEL_444_POST_6=You are with Umlaut! We will knock you out, yas! Down ya go, rocka roller. I'm Hammer, he's Nail. We'll finish you all by breaking ya heads!
LEVEL_444_POST_7=Please, calm yourselves! We are here to defeat Umlaut.
LEVEL_444_POST_8=Defeat? Kill? Umlaut, ya say? Well, why didn't yas say so?! Rhetorical question.
LEVEL_444_POST_9=We'll join you. Free this area we must. Find our soulstones so we can join the fight. Give us great energy they will, yaaaass.
LEVEL_444_POST_10=Thank you. We are thankful that you will stand united with us! We'll find your soulstones. Trust us! We'll come back for you.
LEVEL_447_POST_1=You are one of the ones that poisoned this... place? My humble abode is dying, poisoned with evil spirits and fifth.
LEVEL_447_POST_2=Please, don't kill me. I do not have the energy to defend myself. Mercy.
LEVEL_447_POST_3=Please. Do not worry, we are on your side. We are here to vanquish the evil Umlaut and all minions.
LEVEL_447_POST_4=I don't know how you can. Many have tried, all have failed. I'm forever scarred as my poisoned home serves as a bed for those who have fallen.
LEVEL_447_POST_5=You have buried many fallen heroes here? How horrible...
LEVEL_447_POST_6=Fear no longer. We are not like the previous fallen heroes. Umlaut will tremble and fall.
LEVEL_447_POST_7=Join us, Forgotten Dragon. It is no longer your time to continue hiding in the shadows and among the graves. Now, it's time to fight back.
LEVEL_447_POST_8=There is something about you, Heroes. I trust you, I can feel your powerful light. Please, find my soulstones so I can regain my strength. I will join you in your quest.
LEVEL_447_POST_9=We must stop him now or perish.
LEVEL_447_POST_10=Thank you, Forgotten Dragon. We will be mightier than ever with your help!
LEVEL_447_POST_11=To get out of the forest, please follow the broken stones on the ground. They will lead you to the ruins. Turn left then go straight from the ruin's centre.
LEVEL_447_POST_12=Where will it lead?
LEVEL_447_POST_13=To the Fortress. I fear many secrets lies there.
LEVEL_447_POST_14=We'll come back to you. Let's go, team.
LEVEL_453_PRE_1=AGH! You again?! You lead me the wrong way! That's twice now.
LEVEL_453_PRE_2=What the?! Stop yelling and blaming us for your mistakes.
LEVEL_453_PRE_3=My mistakes? How dare you insult me.
LEVEL_453_PRE_4=I am tired of your garbage!!
LEVEL_453_PRE_5=AND I'M TIRED TOO! LET'S TAKE THIS OUTSIDE!
LEVEL_453_PRE_6=WE ARE OUTSIDE!!
LEVEL_453_PRE_7=I KNOOOW!! RAGHHHHHH!!!
LEVEL_453_POST_1=I am tired. I'm afraid I will never reach paradise. You win.
LEVEL_453_POST_2=Young man. Umlaut will never let you see the beach again if you do not join us to stop him.
LEVEL_453_POST_3=... But, I have never been to the beach. What does it look like?
LEVEL_453_POST_4=....
LEVEL_453_POST_5=Errr.. Eternal Enchanter. Are you sure we can trust him?
LEVEL_453_POST_6=Umlaut. I remember that name. One of the signs back there warned me about him. He is evil. He is corrupt. He must be stopped. I will join you.
LEVEL_453_POST_7=Great!
LEVEL_453_POST_8=... but I am spent...
LEVEL_453_POST_9=Don't worry. We will find your soulstones. When we get them, we'll come back for you. Please rest here until then.
LEVEL_453_POST_10=Ok. I've learned my lesson. I'll listen to you, mate. Please carry on. I will have a little kip here until you return.
LEVEL_456_PRE_1=LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT @#$%^#% GATE!!
LEVEL_456_PRE_2=The stage is set. The audience is here. It's time to see how much you have grown.
LEVEL_456_PRE_3=Audience? Oh, you mean your @#$^*&# ugly Minions.
LEVEL_456_PRE_4=Hush, fool. Listen. ... The music provides a wonderful schmaltzy of orchestral melody. Exquisite beauty, perfectly playing the theme of my coming evolution.
LEVEL_456_PRE_5=*whisper* I think he has a song playing in his head, Unstable Understudy. We do not hear anything.
LEVEL_456_PRE_6=Look, Sven. We are tired of this game of hide-and-seek. Why did you lead us to this place and why do you have so much animosity against us?
LEVEL_456_PRE_7=Animosity? Is that what you call it? You all have the chance to be part of greatness. When we touched hands, I saw it.
LEVEL_456_PRE_8=Give yourself to me. All of you. We shall become one.
LEVEL_456_PRE_9=*gasp* Evolution. Become one. So that is your plan... You want us dead. You want to take our soul energy for your own.
LEVEL_456_PRE_10=If that is what you call it. We... *ahem. I... will conquer all. I will destroy him, destroy Umlaut.
LEVEL_456_PRE_11=And when all is done you will have a new King! All powerful and treacherous as the morn. All shall praise me and despair.
LEVEL_456_PRE_12=WE WILL STOP YOU! No way you will take our soul!
LEVEL_456_PRE_13=Try if you will but inevitability always wins, Heroes. Inevitability always wins.
LEVEL_456_POST_1=*out of breath* Hufffff.... Huffffff...
LEVEL_456_POST_2=HE IS DOWN! KILL 'EMMM!!
LEVEL_456_POST_3=STOP! I think he is back to normal. Shadow of Sven, are you ok?
LEVEL_456_POST_4=I'm so sorry. I wasn't myself. I was aware of what I was doing but, I couldn't stop.
LEVEL_456_POST_5=What happened?
LEVEL_456_POST_6=I believe the process for me to become Shadow of Sven was incomplete. It caused my powers to become unstable.
LEVEL_456_POST_7=It also created a mental limiter that prevented my consciousness from regaining control. The more I fought; the stronger and uncontrollable I became.
LEVEL_456_POST_8=I have heard something similar to this. So, the only way to break your limiter and stabilize your powers was to bring you to near death, correct?
LEVEL_456_POST_9=Correct. I think the darkness that lies within me is still there, but I have regained control; it doesn't control me. Thank you.
LEVEL_456_POST_10=So, what now?
LEVEL_456_POST_11=We'll enter this Fortress of @#$^! Inside, there should be new secrets that will help our quest.
LEVEL_456_POST_12=I want to join you, but my power is low. I need time to recover. Please find my soulstones, it will help me replenish my energy faster so I can join the fight.
LEVEL_456_POST_13=Then into the Fortress, we shall all go. We'll come back for you, Shadow of Sven. Let's go!

LEVEL_457_PRE_2=@#$^^^^^^^^!
LEVEL_457_PRE_3=Unnn-believable. Understudy, did any of your fathers mentioned anything about this?
LEVEL_457_PRE_4=N-no. No. Not at all. They knew about the realm and I vaguely recall them talking about the Fortress,
LEVEL_457_PRE_5=but they never mentioned anything about that. That looks like a town! No, not a town, a...
LEVEL_457_PRE_6=A City.
LEVEL_457_PRE_7=*gulp* It's unreal. Just look at it. We are leagues underground and there use to be an industrialised society! This is blasphemy! Blasphemy!!
LEVEL_457_PRE_8=*rush in* HAHAHAA!! HOLD YOUR *Hic* BAWS! I recognise 'em shapes! Fantastic. Meaning, that wholla biggin over there...

LEVEL_457_PRE_13=*muffled* Growl! Squeak!
LEVEL_457_PRE_14=*draws sword* Squeak?! That sounds like a dragon. Old man?
LEVEL_457_PRE_15=*mumble* Those markings. Where have I see those markings?
LEVEL_457_PRE_16=*muffled* Growl! *power surge*
LEVEL_457_PRE_17=WE MUST CAPTURE THAT EGG AT ALL COST!!

LEVEL_457_POST_11=Same parents they possess, the Crest of Dragons bestowed. Both destined to change the world, choosing the fate of man and beast. One must die to prevent the End of Days."
LEVEL_457_POST_12=No cute egg-y?
LEVEL_457_POST_13=The patterns on the egg and its head. This is no mere Dragon...
LEVEL_457_POST_14=Umlaut is hellbent on ruling this world through terror and force, but this little one is destined to save it. Everyone, this is the Chosen One. The one that will defeat Umlaut once and for all.
LEVEL_457_POST_15=WHAT?! But it's just a baby!
LEVEL_457_POST_16=Squeak...
LEVEL_457_POST_17=AGH! Egg-y. Come back, Egg-y! Don't leave.
LEVEL_457_POST_18=It doesn't' trust us. I suspect the enemies convinced it to attack us earlier. Dragon Lady, the Chosen One must stay with us. Umlaut will come for its life.
LEVEL_457_POST_19=Archer! You are up. I want you and Ninja Dwarf to pair up. We need your navigation skills!
LEVEL_457_POST_20=Finally! You asked for plenty big girl. You shall not regret this! Let's call the little one, Unripe Hatchling. Chosen One was taken.
LEVEL_460_PRE_1=Magnificent. This hall is like a museum. If you look carefully, you can see it use to showcase a beautiful array of marble columns, gold leaf ornamentation,
LEVEL_460_PRE_2=the vaulted ceiling embedded with stucco details and bronze chandeliers.
LEVEL_460_PRE_3=Yas. *hic* The magnificent of my Dwarves families and other families beyooond. Drink ta dat! *glug glug*
LEVEL_460_PRE_4=But, the smell of death here is so strong. A foul rotten putrid stench of rotten eggs mixed with sulphur.
LEVEL_460_PRE_5=Sorry, I think that's me.
LEVEL_460_PRE_6=Disgusting!!
LEVEL_460_PRE_7=Me want toilet!
LEVEL_460_PRE_8=*shove* Get away from me, stinker!
LEVEL_460_PRE_9=Blah! We travelled for miles, crossed seas and mountains, lavas and valleys, battled atrocities for over a year and not ONCE you wanted to go?!
LEVEL_460_PRE_10=Truth told with bad intent is stronger than all the lies you can ever muster, Understudy. Do not insult those who always have your back in battle.
LEVEL_460_PRE_11=... Sorry.
LEVEL_460_PRE_12=Stay on your guard. We must not take these enemies likely. Looki 'ere. Its Unripe, and she's not alone.
LEVEL_460_PRE_13=*muffled* Growwwwwwl!
LEVEL_460_PRE_14=Damn minions. Take them out! Archer, assist!
LEVEL_460_PRE_15=Gladly! For Dwarfhalla!!
LEVEL_460_POST_1=Listen, you must come with us. Umlaut wants to kill you. Those enemies are not your friends. We are here to protect you. For your protection, please come with us.
LEVEL_460_POST_2=Growwwwwwl!
LEVEL_460_POST_3=You will be safe with us, I promise. We'll call you Unripe Hatchling, alright?
LEVEL_460_POST_4=Growl...
LEVEL_460_POST_5=What should we do? She still doesn't trust us.
LEVEL_460_POST_6=Perhaps the answer lies within the book.
LEVEL_460_POST_7=Come here, Egg-y. Come here, Egg-y.
LEVEL_460_POST_8=Growl??
LEVEL_460_POST_9=Madness! Stop him!
LEVEL_460_POST_10=Patience, Understudy. Even beasts of all kinds can have a heart more pure than humans. Look.
LEVEL_460_POST_11=Ahhh! Egg-y Egg-y! Cute Egg-y. You stay with me now.
LEVEL_460_POST_12=By the Lords of Time. Well done, Electroyeti. It appears that she likes you.
LEVEL_460_POST_13=Electroyeti, I guess I have been a little insensitive. I'm sorry, I'll try to be more open minded towards you.
LEVEL_460_POST_14=Yawn...
LEVEL_460_POST_15=Egg-y sleep now. Don't worry. We'll find your SoulStones. It will make you stronger.
LEVEL_460_POST_16=Looks like it is futile to resist you, Electroyeti. Pick up Unripe. We must go.
LEVEL_463_PRE_1=This way. I believe this will take us out of harm's way.
LEVEL_463_PRE_2=Wait a minute! I should be leading! Me fellow Dwarves built this place.
LEVEL_463_PRE_3=True. They did! But you didn't.
LEVEL_463_PRE_4=Oh... *hic*

LEVEL_463_PRE_6=Noo jist haud on, yer doin' ma heid in! Something behind us, alrite. Let's just... Wait! Now it's in front of us.
LEVEL_463_PRE_7=Ahh. Finally, we meet.
LEVEL_463_PRE_8=You were the one that been following us.
LEVEL_463_PRE_9=What does the Dark lord see in you. All I see is flesh, annoying disruptive flesh that must fall at my feet.
LEVEL_463_PRE_10=You do not appear to be possessed. Who are you, and what do you want with us?
LEVEL_463_PRE_11=I? I am the one that will deliver your souls to the lord. I am the one that will make you and all other heroes tremble. I will crush the life out of you and all my enemies for I am, Black Wing.
LEVEL_463_PRE_12=I've heard of you! You are..

LEVEL_463_PRE_17=AhhhhHHH! So be it. *lick lips* You'll be first.
LEVEL_463_POST_1=*panting* You... You pretended to fall.
LEVEL_463_POST_2=Curse you, creature!
LEVEL_463_POST_3=Hahahaha! Death will come to you. You are nothing but a disease, something for me to stamp on before I take your soul. You so called, heroes, are a plague and we are the cure.
LEVEL_463_POST_4=If you think we've given up, think again!
LEVEL_463_POST_5=Then show me, heroes. Show me. Come to the Dungeon. Show me your all.
LEVEL_466_PRE_1=Filth! We'll show you.

LEVEL_466_POST_3=Destroy?! Let me show you the way to hell.
LEVEL_466_POST_4=After him! Do not let him escape.
LEVEL_469_PRE_1=Black Wing seems to have disappeared! Ugh! That smell we smelt earlier is stronger here. Don't worry, I know it's not you, Electroyeti.
LEVEL_469_PRE_2=Wait. Over there. It looks like large Dragon and it appears to be... eating.
LEVEL_469_PRE_3=What a slob. It's eating anything it see. Obese!
LEVEL_469_PRE_4=I fear this beast fare no relation to Unripe.
LEVEL_469_PRE_5=*Sniff* *Sniff sniff* Egg? EGG!!
LEVEL_469_PRE_6=Be on your guard!!
LEVEL_469_PRE_7=Oh boy oh boy oh boy! It's been a long time such kind people brought a gift for me. *claps giddily* Uh huh. I'd like that egg raw instead of scrambled.
LEVEL_469_PRE_8=I like scrambled!
LEVEL_469_PRE_9=Put it in my mouth. Come on! I'm top of the food chain.
LEVEL_469_PRE_10=You cannot have it and we are not your servants!
LEVEL_469_PRE_11=ROAR!! I'm hungry! In that case, human, beast and egg are on the menu! That dwarf. It's like a baby. I want those baby ribs! Time for you all to get in ma belly!!
LEVEL_469_POST_1=ROAR!! I'm not done with you! I'll show you who is King! Meet me at the tower. Yum yum yam! Hahahahaha!
LEVEL_472_PRE_1=Black Wing.
LEVEL_472_PRE_2=*Smile*
LEVEL_472_POST_1=You think you've won... You haven't won anything. They will be back for you, they always come back.
LEVEL_472_POST_2=I knew I have heard about you from somewhere. You are the unsung hero! You...
LEVEL_472_POST_3=QUIET!!
LEVEL_472_POST_4=eek! But you are a hero!
LEVEL_472_POST_5=I work for Umlaut!!
LEVEL_472_POST_6=You were never possessed. Why did you pretend to work for Umlaut? Why did you fight against us?
LEVEL_472_POST_7=These walls have ears. Be careful with what you say.
LEVEL_472_POST_8=Tell us the truth!
LEVEL_472_POST_9=You are not ready for the truth but I'll tell you what. I will help you, help everyone. One condition, do not reveal me to Umlaut nor to any of his minions.
LEVEL_472_POST_10=Whenever we rage battle against any of Umlaut's minions or servants, we must take them out quickly. Leave no witnesses. Link NOTHING back to me, understood?
LEVEL_472_POST_11=What a strange game you are playing, hero. Alright, we'll play it your way.
LEVEL_472_POST_12=Do not falter, do not forget. Otherwise, I'll take you all out myself. Bring me my SoulStones. I'll tell you everything when you've collected them and we are on our way to Umlaut.
LEVEL_475_PRE_1=*mumbles*
LEVEL_475_PRE_2=*mumbles*
LEVEL_475_PRE_3=?? Who are they? The lights back in the corridors affected my vision so I cannot see clearly.
LEVEL_475_PRE_4=*mumbles* *vanish*
LEVEL_475_PRE_5=*mumbles*
LEVEL_475_PRE_6=Understudy. Who was he talking to?!
LEVEL_475_PRE_7=... I'm not sure... I don't know what they were saying, but I recognise the language. It was the language used in the Draconian era, a language used by Umlaut.
LEVEL_475_PRE_8=Umlaut?! Don't tell me that connection was just a coincidence.
LEVEL_475_PRE_9=*turns head towards heroes* AGH! Ya early! Let's settle this once and for all! I want yah for dinner!
LEVEL_475_PRE_10=Dragon! You are connected to Umlaut, aren't you?!
LEVEL_475_PRE_11=That's none of your concern. You only need to know one thing.
LEVEL_475_PRE_12=And what would that be, Dragon?
LEVEL_475_PRE_13=That you belong in 'ere!! Come on. Get in! Get into ma belly! ROAR!!
LEVEL_475_PRE_14=Green eyes?! I knew it. Team, he is possessed like the others we've fought!!
LEVEL_475_PRE_15=GET IN MA BELLY!!
LEVEL_475_POST_1=Ouch. Don't hurt me anymore. I got a toothache.
LEVEL_475_POST_2=You tried to eat us!
LEVEL_475_POST_3=I'm sorry. I was possessed and when hunger strikes, I would eat anything. Owwww...! This pain is unbearable.
LEVEL_475_POST_4=EXTRACTIO! There. I've fixed your problem.
LEVEL_475_POST_5=Ah! The pain is gone! Hahahaha! I'm your friend now. Whenever you need help, just ask!
LEVEL_475_POST_6=Wonderful! Come follow us. We could use your knowledge to find a way out of here and find Umlaut.
LEVEL_475_POST_7=Out of the Fortress? But I'm King here.
LEVEL_475_POST_8=Quite the contrary. This place is close to ruins and your regular visitors were the bugs you passionately ate. Sorry to be harsh but you are the king of nothing.
LEVEL_475_POST_9=Put down the fat slob why don't cha! Ok, follow me. I will lead you back to the undergrounds and show you the best route to Umlaut.
LEVEL_475_POST_10=You see dat round black cloud in the sky? Dat cloud is covering a large hole behind it, our exit. We have to climb a treacherous cliff to reach it.
LEVEL_475_POST_11=By the beard of Ninja Dwarf, thank goodness!
LEVEL_475_POST_12=Ay! *hic* Me 'aaf no beard.
LEVEL_475_POST_13=Excellent. Lead us there. It's time for us to smell some real fresh air!
LEVEL_475_POST_14=No problemero, Dragon Ladimero! *zap* Ouch!
LEVEL_475_POST_15=Egg-y's not food!
LEVEL_475_POST_16=Sorry.

#Chapter 26 Release 2.18.0
LEVEL_476_PRE_1=Water! I need @#$^%@& water!
LEVEL_476_PRE_2=This heat is unbearable, especially after fighting those enemies earlier.
LEVEL_476_PRE_3=Madness. I'm not made for this heat. Give me a haircut! I don't care. Ugh. Look! Egg-y is suffering too.
LEVEL_476_PRE_4=*snooze* *electric motor*
LEVEL_476_PRE_5=What the?! Yeti, the egg feels cold like... I can't believe it. There is an air conditioner unit inside the egg!
LEVEL_476_PRE_6=That... *pant* resourceful little bugger! Come 'ere! That egg must have room for one more! *pant* I'm too fat... I can't take this.
LEVEL_476_PRE_7=Eternal. We need to get out of this heat otherwise all of us won't survive here much longer.
LEVEL_476_PRE_8=Finding shelter needs to wait. We got company.
LEVEL_476_PRE_9=Glad to see someone's fighting sense is still on alert. Heroes, we are not out of the woods yet.
LEVEL_476_PRE_10=And you will never be out of the woods! We'll pike out your spines and make you suffer!
LEVEL_476_PRE_11=Digger Mole. The last surviving warrior and inhabitant of the underworld. King of the Molarks, the people's champion, and a long way from home.
LEVEL_476_PRE_12=Black Wing. The treacherous man-dragon who I'd like to call a demon. A snake, a murderer, deceiver. Such villainy disgusts me, Umlaut worshipper.
LEVEL_476_PRE_13=*Looks at Black Wing and Digger Mole* I see that you've both know each other.
LEVEL_476_PRE_14=That is no surprised as it's too easy to bump into this creature and his rat circus he calls a Kingdom run by Molarks.
LEVEL_476_PRE_15=Black Wing. Digger Mole looks adorable!! Digger Mole, can I have a hug?
LEVEL_476_PRE_16=Silent, land-walkers!! You'll pay for your insolences. Molarks, attack! Rip off their heads and give them to me. Show me you are ready to join paradise!
LEVEL_476_POST_1=You think you've won? You haven't won anything. You know the saying, "all good things come to those who waits". Umlaut worshippers.
LEVEL_476_POST_2=Worshippers?! Listen, Mr Cute Mole. We mean no harm.
LEVEL_476_POST_3=That's Digger Mole! Digger Mole! And you'll pay, land-walkers. You'll pay for your evil alliance with that demon beside you.
LEVEL_476_POST_4=How could you all side with him? That demon!
LEVEL_476_POST_5=Listen to me. There is clearly a misunderstanding. We know that he is working for Umlaut, but he is undercover.
LEVEL_476_POST_6=Undercover?! Misunderstanding?! He killed several of my people!! Murdered them in cold blood!!
LEVEL_476_POST_7=You have no idea what you are talking about.
LEVEL_476_POST_8=No idea?! I was there, demon. I saw you holding them limped bodies, you hand was around their throat! You killed them! You did it.
LEVEL_476_POST_9=But we won't take our revenge now. No, demon, there is a time and place for everything. We hunted you for years, waiting a few more days is no big deal. We'll see you again soon. *burrow underground*
LEVEL_476_POST_10=Black Wing?
LEVEL_476_POST_11=What is it?
LEVEL_476_POST_12=The truth. What is your mission? What happened before? Who are you?
LEVEL_476_POST_13=I'll tell you after we defeat Digger Mole. He will come again soon. We must be ready.
LEVEL_476_POST_14=Black Wing. If any harm comes to my team due to your actions, you'll have to answer to me. For now, let's keep progressing forward for we must get out of the sun. Eternal, lead the way.
LEVEL_479_PRE_1=The sky looks beautiful. I never knew there were so many stars.
LEVEL_479_PRE_2=I would appreciate it further if it wasn't freezing! I never imagine the desert would be such an endurance test. I would use my magic to stay warm but... Huh?? Sun Seeker!?
LEVEL_479_PRE_3=Ah-haa! You left me behind.
LEVEL_479_PRE_4=Now wait a minute! You are not going to fight us again, are you? We had an agreement!
LEVEL_479_PRE_5=No no! Don't worry, I was trying to catch up and thanks to him, I was able to join you fellows.
LEVEL_479_PRE_6=Him? Oh. I must thank you, kind Sir...
LEVEL_479_PRE_7=It's my pleasure. My-y-y pleasur-r-r-e....
LEVEL_479_PRE_8=*silent* ...
LEVEL_479_PRE_9=We rode on his goat! His goat! Isn't that the GOAT?
LEVEL_479_PRE_10=... Sun Seeker? Step away from the goat and walk slowly towards me.
LEVEL_479_PRE_11=*slowly withdraw his weapon*
LEVEL_479_PRE_12=Ahhh... *slowly pulls out his weapons*
LEVEL_479_PRE_13=Wait a sec! You must see this goat for it's the GOAT! You see what I did there?
LEVEL_479_PRE_14=Sun Seeker. I won't tell you twice. Come here.
LEVEL_479_PRE_15=But the goat!
LEVEL_479_PRE_16=You stupid @#$%^&# idiot! Your friend's eyes are green! He's possessed! Get the @#$% away from him!
LEVEL_479_PRE_17=Ahh. Green. Right. *runs towards Dragon Lady* Urm... Let's beat him before he beats us!
LEVEL_479_PRE_18=I don't like to do this to a fellow dwarf *draws arrows* but we must wake you up, my brother.
LEVEL_479_PRE_19=Brother? *points weapons at Heroes* I am old enough to be your Father.
LEVEL_479_PRE_20=*points arrow at Ancient Dwarf* Don't do this.
LEVEL_479_PRE_21=And it's time for this Father to give you a spanking.
LEVEL_479_POST_1=*panting* Stand down.
LEVEL_479_POST_2=Stand down? I am winning.
LEVEL_479_POST_3=You are delusional. Stand down!
LEVEL_479_POST_4=Ah. I seem to be missing my comrades. You'll live for now... Heroes.
LEVEL_479_POST_5=You must wake up, my fellow dwarf brother.
LEVEL_479_POST_6=Black Wing. I've been watching you the whole time. Why do you stand with them? You are one of us.
LEVEL_479_POST_7=Use your brains and stand down, warrior!
LEVEL_479_POST_8=Insolent traitor. When I come back, I will take these heroes out. Then I'll take YOU out. *rides away*
LEVEL_479_POST_9=Everyone! We must capture that Dwarf otherwise he will blow my cover!
LEVEL_479_POST_10=If my fat memories serve me correctly. He is heading toward Umlaut's direction.
LEVEL_479_POST_11=You don't need to tell me twice. Let's go!
LEVEL_482_PRE_1=Come forth, dearies.
LEVEL_482_PRE_2=No no no. Boys, stay with us.
LEVEL_482_PRE_3=Come forth. I won't bite. *dance* Umlaut would like a word with you, strong men.
LEVEL_482_PRE_4=*dreamy* So enchanting... Dreamy. Senorita, let's make a sweet performance together.
LEVEL_482_PRE_5=*dreamy* Yes, my love. We'll come and serve you. Don't worry, my legs have a mind of its own.
LEVEL_482_PRE_6=Dragon Lady, we must stop her magic! Us females don't seem to be affected. Sojourner, use your potion! Stop her!
LEVEL_482_PRE_7=*bang* You guys owe me a drink!
LEVEL_482_PRE_8=*cough cough* That stinks!
LEVEL_482_PRE_9=Don't be foolish to go against me, my sisters. I am an empress here and no traveller can resist my power.
LEVEL_482_PRE_10=I am not a man so your seduction have no affect on me!
LEVEL_482_PRE_11=No, you are not. You are just a little girl that looks like a reject from the cast of Harry Pottee. Ooooooahahahahahaha! You have my pity.
LEVEL_482_PRE_12=Ugh! How dare you compare me to that idiot!
LEVEL_482_PRE_13=*hysterical laughter* Hahahahahaha! *puff* Hahahahaha! *puff* Hahaa!!
LEVEL_482_PRE_14=Ughhhhhhhhhh! I'M GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS!!
LEVEL_482_PRE_15=Yeessss! We are going kick the @#$^ outta her!
LEVEL_482_POST_1=We are not done here, you evil travellers. Watch your back. You'll never know what will come up behind you.
LEVEL_482_POST_2=She's gone! That little teaser is gone! I wanna rip her tail off!
LEVEL_482_POST_3=Relax senorita. Thanks to your quick thinking, we're good! No?
LEVEL_482_POST_4=I'm still going to drown her with my potions when I see her.
LEVEL_482_POST_5=You are too violent, Sojourner. Sometimes more so than I can bare. That woman with all that fox hair... She reminds me of someone.
LEVEL_482_POST_6=... There is nothing to think about. When we see her next time, let's break her hip!
LEVEL_482_POST_7=... You are probably right.
LEVEL_482_POST_8=Let's raid for clues. We already got one enemy to worry about and it's clear that Umlaut was here. I'm sure we will find something useful.
LEVEL_485_PRE_1=You heroes are lucky that you have someone like her. You all were awfully close to have your heads lopped off by my Molarks.
LEVEL_485_PRE_2=I never thought you would stoop this low, Digger Mole.
LEVEL_485_PRE_3=So said the scum who killed my people! Don't act like you are righteous when the blood on your hands runs deep enough to fill a valley.
LEVEL_485_PRE_4=Ughhh!
LEVEL_485_PRE_5=That's right. Get angry, demon! It makes it easier for us to take your life!
LEVEL_485_PRE_6=Digger Mole, we are not your enemy! Why can't you see that?!
LEVEL_485_PRE_7=Ignorant land-walker. Why don't YOU heed my words?! That demon will turn on you soon as he gets the chance.
LEVEL_485_PRE_8=Ughhh! I'm going to kill you! *aura rising*
LEVEL_485_PRE_9=You are still angry?! Do you want to make amends? Bring me back my people! Bring back the fathers, the mothers, the children!! BRING BACK THOSE YOU HAVE KILLED!
LEVEL_485_PRE_10=Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!!
LEVEL_485_PRE_11=BRING THEM BACK!!
LEVEL_485_PRE_12=I NEVER KILLED THEM!
LEVEL_485_PRE_13=LIAR! NOW FEEL MY CLAWS, DEMON!!
LEVEL_485_POST_1=*pant* Demon. You won't escape us... You are a murderer...
LEVEL_485_POST_2=*pant* The night of pain, I remember it well. I was the captain of the death troopers; an elite squad formed by the dark lord. Our mission, seek and destroy all those that stood before him.
LEVEL_485_POST_3=Why save a few when you can save many? By becoming the captain I believed I could save many lives. I can learn Umlaut's weakness too. It was a good plan, but I knew I couldn't pull it off alone.
LEVEL_485_POST_4=So a pastor from Digger Mole's village partnered with me. Our roles were modest, I distract the troops, he saves the victims. It was a good plan, but I was overzealous on that night of pain.
LEVEL_485_POST_5=... I knew you are a hero... What happened?
LEVEL_485_POST_6=On a stormy night in the underworld, the troopers disobeyed my orders and followed me into a nearby village. They believed they were doing me a favour so they killed everyone when I wasn't looking...
LEVEL_485_POST_7=The women, the children, my partner who I couldn't inform. They laughed sadistically at their accomplishment.  They gave me the head of my partner as a trophy; a gift they said. So I destroyed them.
LEVEL_485_POST_8=Every one of 'em.
LEVEL_485_POST_9=... You are a stinking liar! I SAW YOU WITH THE BOY!
LEVEL_485_POST_10=When the rain washed the blood from my eyes, I saw a child wincing in pain... Comfort was all I could provide until his passing. So young, so tender... He had no chance to see why life is precious.
LEVEL_485_POST_11=It was a good plan, it was. But I wasn't good enough.
LEVEL_485_POST_12=And Umlaut?
LEVEL_485_POST_13=I told him a powerful hero destroyed the team while we were wiping out the villagers. I was the sole survivor of the attack. I promised the dark lord that I will hunt that hero down.
LEVEL_485_POST_14=So that's the truth you've been hiding. Digger Mole, you've heard. I believe him.
LEVEL_485_POST_15=I don't believe him! He is a demon! I saw him.
LEVEL_485_POST_16=On that night, did you also see weapons and armory on the floor?
LEVEL_485_POST_17=... Yes. ... *pause*
LEVEL_485_POST_18=Black Wing. Our quarrels has ended as the real enemy has been identified. Let me and my army join your team. Find my soulstones. I'll fight alongside you to destroy Umlaut.
LEVEL_485_POST_19=Yes! *hug* Welcome to the team, cutey Mole! You are so adorable when you are not serious.
LEVEL_485_POST_20=*blush* I know this desert. Around or near here lies the Acolyte Statue. One of my Molark saw Umlaut going towards the area where they lay. We must make sure he never gets his hands on it.
LEVEL_485_POST_21=I've heard the result would be disastrous if he released its power.
LEVEL_485_POST_22=I've heard about this too. The Acolyte Statue seals a great god-like creature.
LEVEL_485_POST_23=Let's march forward. We must find those statues before Umlaut does.
LEVEL_485_POST_24=*whisper* Too Convenient... Something doesn't feel right. Eternal, keep a close eye on Black Wing. For now, the enemy of my enemy is my friend until proven otherwise.
LEVEL_488_PRE_1=Let's get on with it.
LEVEL_488_PRE_2=As you wish. It's fitting as you killed my clan.
LEVEL_488_PRE_3=So that's why you are angry with us. It was not us who killed your clan. Let's eradicate Umlaut together for he is manipulating you!
LEVEL_488_PRE_4=Quiet! Prepare yourself.
LEVEL_488_POST_1=*pant* Ugh. Where am I? What are we doing here.
LEVEL_488_POST_2=Finally. You've snapped out of it.
LEVEL_488_POST_3=*mumbles* Now.. Let's see. I'm holding my weapon. There are a bunch of monsters, dragons and humans in front of me. My head isn't feeling great but a rose is a rose is a rose. 
LEVEL_488_POST_4=Tell me, is there anything useful you could tell us. How did you get possessed?
LEVEL_488_POST_5=Possessed? You can't fool me, you were trying to kill me!
LEVEL_488_POST_6=Nonsense! How did you reach that conclusion?!
LEVEL_488_POST_7=Nonsense?! Then why are all your weapons drawn out? Do you think this is a dance?! You are making my blood boil with anger!
LEVEL_488_POST_8= Stupid old Dwarf! You attacked us because Umlaut posses...  OW! Tell your stupid goat to stop eating my hair!!
LEVEL_488_POST_9=Strange... My goat only likes eating the hair of someone who speaks the truth.
LEVEL_488_POST_10=Heroes. Look over there. *points at a wall* Can you read it?
LEVEL_488_POST_11=Ow! Tell him to stop or I'll feed him to Greedy Dragon!
LEVEL_488_POST_12=Goat chops?!! *claps giddily* Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!
LEVEL_488_POST_13=Quiet! Centaur, there is something on those walls. Can you decipher it?
LEVEL_488_POST_14=Pictograms. Extraordinary. It says that the Acolyte Statue is near and must not be disturb or see the destruction of the world. 
LEVEL_488_POST_15=Damn you, monsters. You want to revive that statue?!
LEVEL_488_POST_16=Huh?! You told us to read it!
LEVEL_488_POST_17=I will retreat for now but mark my words, when I come back I'll have your heads!
LEVEL_488_POST_18=UGH! You stupid old Dwarf!! You are just an ancient confused old fart! Forgetting your own words! Misunderstanding everything!
LEVEL_488_POST_19=Hey! That's Ancient Dwarf to you! Old Fart is my cousin. *trots away*
LEVEL_488_POST_20=Unreal...
LEVEL_491_PRE_1=I see Ancient Dwarf didn't finish you off. Now, I'll take your money and your life.
LEVEL_491_PRE_2=Finally! Now it's on, you vixen @#$^!!
LEVEL_491_POST_1=No more. No more.
LEVEL_491_POST_2=You are faking it! AGHHH!!!
LEVEL_491_POST_3=Stop! Her eyes are no longer green. She is back to normal!
LEVEL_491_POST_4=I'm going to punch your head off!
LEVEL_491_POST_5=Eternal! Bind her!!
LEVEL_491_POST_6=Time Freeze!! *zapp*
LEVEL_491_POST_7=You son of a @#$^! I can't move.
LEVEL_491_POST_8=We'll let you go when you've cooled off, Sojourner!
LEVEL_491_POST_9=*cries*
LEVEL_491_POST_10=Don't cry. This is Umlaut doing.
LEVEL_491_POST_11=Umlaut killed my parents right in front of me and killed all the heroes that came to visit my Oasis then he forced me to extort all the travellers that visitors before pushing me to kill them!! *panting* HE MUST PAY-Y-Y!!
LEVEL_491_POST_12=*pause* Well that escalated quickly.
LEVEL_491_POST_13=Who are you?
LEVEL_491_POST_14=Foxy!! I knew it was you!
LEVEL_491_POST_15=Thief!! W-what are you doing here!?
LEVEL_491_POST_16=You both know each other??
LEVEL_491_POST_17=Yes. This is Enigma Fox but everyone calls her Foxy. I knew Foxy when we were teenagers. She is a princess and an incredible dancer.
LEVEL_491_POST_18=I WAS a princess. I've lost everything. Umlaut took all I had and desecrated these lands. He killed my mother and father in front of me like a sick game.
LEVEL_491_POST_19=Will you join us, Enigma Fox? We are heading towards the Acolyte Statue. It should be beyond that sandstorm heading towards us.
LEVEL_491_POST_20=No problem. And please find my Soulstone so I can join you in battle! I want to show Umlaut what real power is. Heart!
LEVEL_491_POST_21=Ugh! A Care Bears lover. Gr-r-reat.
LEVEL_494_PRE_1=I haven't moved. I'm scared. I think a giant enemy is approaching with its own Never Return Alive theme song.
LEVEL_494_PRE_2=M-my g-g-gosh! W-what is that?!
LEVEL_494_PRE_3=*explosion* After 5,000 years, I live again!! Returning through the doorway of death. Mortals, tremble! Anubis is here for you to serve.
LEVEL_494_PRE_4=*shaking* I-I can f-feel her po-power. She is too strong! Absurdly strong.
LEVEL_494_PRE_5=Stay calm, Understudy.
LEVEL_494_PRE_6=Anubis! We heroes are here to find and destroy the evil one named Umlaut.  He is a murderer, a conqueror, he ruined the lives of thousands.
LEVEL_494_PRE_7=He already ruling these lands but his tyranny must stop here. Will you help us?
LEVEL_494_PRE_8=Ahh. Come here, my servant. Your sacrifice will fill your queen.
LEVEL_494_PRE_9=*shock* By the Lords of Time! She devoured that monster's soul.
LEVEL_494_PRE_10=Be on your guard, team. I don't think she is here to talk.
LEVEL_494_PRE_11=Ahh. I feel, better. I need more. More soul.
LEVEL_494_PRE_12=And you are correct. I am not here to talk, Dragon Woman.
LEVEL_494_PRE_13=Y-you know me?
LEVEL_494_PRE_14=I am 5,000 years of power. I am lived a thousand lifetimes. I can see into the souls of all and I have already read into yours.
LEVEL_494_PRE_15=And your soul will serve me well, Dragon Woman. Your soul will bring me back to my prime.
LEVEL_494_PRE_16=Lady! You address her as Dragon Lady and screw you! We'll make you burn and tap out before tea-time!
LEVEL_494_PRE_17=Quiet Sun Seeker. We may be able to convince her to join us and fight against Umlaut!
LEVEL_494_PRE_18=Me? Join you! Against Umlaut? Haha! Young fools. Haven't you heard?! Never bite the hand that feeds you.
LEVEL_494_POST_1=*panting* Strong. So strong.
LEVEL_494_POST_2=STAND DOWN!
LEVEL_494_POST_3=*licking her lips* Hahaha! Wonderful, so wonderful! I can feel your power. It increases every time you fight, every time you train. It's good. Good!
LEVEL_494_POST_4=Lol! Get stronger, heroes! Power yourself. Become stronger than Umlaut so when I take your souls, I'll be strong enough to become a true God.
LEVEL_494_POST_5=You almost sound like Sven when he went crazy. I knew there was a connection!
LEVEL_494_POST_6=Anubis. Don't you know that Umlaut is using you?!
LEVEL_494_POST_7=Is he using me? Or am I using him?
LEVEL_494_POST_8=I remember you from my books! You were a messenger of the Gods that fell in love with a human.
LEVEL_494_POST_9=Quiet child!
LEVEL_494_POST_10=You loved him so much, you tried to become human yourself... but someone sabotage your magic which turned you into what you are now.
LEVEL_494_POST_11=You know nothing, child! It was my mistake!
LEVEL_494_POST_12=No! The books were clear! You thought you made the mistake but it was someone else. Someone ruined your spell! Maybe a jealous...
LEVEL_494_POST_13=Shut-up! You speak not!
LEVEL_494_POST_14=Anubis. My fellow heroes are highly versed with magic and sorcery. I believe we can bring you to your intended human form. Join us so we can find a way together.
LEVEL_494_POST_15=You are just trying to appeal to me...
LEVEL_494_POST_16=I believ...
LEVEL_494_POST_17=SILENCE! Foolish mortals. You know nothing though the power of the soulstone shines strong within you. I'll leave you all for now but understand this.
LEVEL_494_POST_18=There is another Acolyte Statue beyond the desert towards the direction of sunrise.  Soon, you won't just feel my wrath, you'll feel the wrath of another. *strong wind*
LEVEL_494_POST_19=She disappeared.
LEVEL_494_POST_20=Another statue?!
LEVEL_494_POST_21=Umlaut is playing a dangerous game. Perhaps one that might be over his head.
LEVEL_494_POST_22=Heroes. Let's push on. No one threatens us. We'll fight on for freedom and kick the @#$&^ of all that oppose us!
LEVEL_494_POST_23=@#$& yeah!!
LEVEL_494_POST_24=Move out!!

#Chapter 27 Release 2.19.0
LEVEL_495_PRE_1=Finally. I can breathe. Cool air at last. The desert was unbearable.
LEVEL_495_PRE_2=I think I've dropped over 30 pounds.
LEVEL_495_PRE_3=It's beautiful. The vegetation looks incredibly steeped in plushness and opulence. The tall trees peer above us like a guardian defending its children. How could anyone resist such a luscious Garden of Eden?
LEVEL_495_PRE_4=Are you feeling homesick? Sorry, now is not the time.
LEVEL_495_PRE_5=Hold onto your tongue, Yeti. You should treat our newest team member with respect and dignity, not with your witty comments. 
LEVEL_495_PRE_6=*snarl* Destroy the heroes.
LEVEL_495_PRE_7=Understudy, who is this...?
LEVEL_495_PRE_8=Come to me. 
LEVEL_495_PRE_9=Understudy?
LEVEL_495_PRE_10=*reach out for Dragon Lady's neck* Fe-e-e-e-el my wra-a-a-ath.
LEVEL_495_PRE_11=UNDERSTUDY.
LEVEL_495_PRE_12=Hold your horses! Err. No offence, Centaur.
LEVEL_495_PRE_13=None taken.
LEVEL_495_PRE_14=Sorry. I was searching through my books for information. I found a passage describing an ancient god that bestowed powers to a divine beast so it can serve as guardian of the Acolyte Statue.
LEVEL_495_PRE_15=The beast guarded the statue for centuries, protecting whatever secret is inside.
LEVEL_495_PRE_16=CUT TO THE DAMN CHASE FOR HE IS REACHING FOR MY NECK. IS HE GOOD OR BAD?
LEVEL_495_PRE_17=Bad! Bad! Right now, he is bad! Look! He sided with our enemies!
LEVEL_495_PRE_18=Back off, Beast. *Draws sword* We're not afraid to defend ourselves. Don't make us hurt you.
LEVEL_495_POST_1=*breath out smoke* Hahahahaa.
LEVEL_495_POST_2=*panting* We do not want to hurt you. Please, lower your weapon so we can talk.
LEVEL_495_POST_3=This battle is yours, he-ro-o-o-oes. But I, Snapper Bone, will never yield.
LEVEL_495_POST_4=Yield? We want you to be our friend. Join us. 
LEVEL_495_POST_5=You should have finished me when my back was on the ground. Now you have missed that chance. *vanish*
LEVEL_495_POST_6=Stupid monsters. Don't they know how to have a civil conversation?
LEVEL_495_POST_7=I guess not. *sigh*
LEVEL_495_POST_8=You cannot save everyone, Dragon Lady
LEVEL_495_POST_9=There is always a way. Let's move out. We shouldn't keep hanging around here. We must find shelter to rest. 
LEVEL_498_PRE_1=Come here, slow coaches. Behold. Welcome to the Ancient City of Alter World.
LEVEL_498_PRE_2=It's beautiful. The architectural designs, the craftsmanship. I feel this place use to be full of peace and tranquillity.
LEVEL_498_PRE_3=You guys are @#$^&!# crazy. You looking at the scenery while we are in the middle of a fight? The enemies are right over there.
LEVEL_498_PRE_4=You are a witty little monster, aren't you? I can see why my goat took a liking to you.
LEVEL_498_PRE_5=Umlaut, must have gone up those stairways beyond the large building over there.
LEVEL_498_PRE_6=Why are we going there again?
LEVEL_498_PRE_7=We are here to stop Umlaut from taking powers from the Acolyte Statues. Haven't you been paying attention, child?
LEVEL_498_PRE_8=Unlike you, I know Umlaut like the back of my hand. I have fought against that tyrant several times; I know his every move.
LEVEL_498_PRE_9=Three times. When we left the desert, you told us you fought against him three times.
LEVEL_498_PRE_10=And now I'm going to conquer and deliver him the biggest spanking of his life using my old man's Dwarf belt, passed down from my father and my father's father. The thrashing he will receive... *deep breath* it will be bliss.
LEVEL_498_PRE_11=You lost when you fought him. You lost all three times. You won't be conquering him by yourself as you need our help. Your memory is unbelievable.
LEVEL_498_PRE_12=Hush woman. You dare disrespect me? You are lucky I admired and adored you and your heroes when we first met, but that admiration can change.
LEVEL_498_PRE_13=YOU WERE GOING TO KILL US. Sojourner, make a potion to fix this Dwarf's memory. We cannot have him jeopardising our mission.
LEVEL_498_PRE_14=And you said I wasn't paying attention. At least I can keep my facts straight.
LEVEL_498_PRE_15=Quiet, you.
LEVEL_498_PRE_16=*bang* You heroes will march forward no longer. Your evil ways will end here.
LEVEL_498_PRE_17=Snapper Bone you are controlled by the evil one called Umlaut.
LEVEL_498_PRE_18=You all talk too much. He is stopping us from getting to Umlaut. Take him out, now. *charge forward* ATTACK.
LEVEL_498_PRE_19=No, wait! *runs after Ancient Dwarf* Don't you all just stand there, help him.
LEVEL_498_POST_1=Who shall I pay credence for setting me free?
LEVEL_498_POST_2=Snapper Bone, we believed you were under Umlaut's spell. How do you feel now?
LEVEL_498_POST_3=The prophecy has spoken. You are all destined to battle against he that can devour the hearts & souls of man, beast and monsters.
LEVEL_498_POST_4=I see one of you is already more than acquainted to his darkness *stares at Black Wing*
LEVEL_498_POST_5=So said the beast with no eyes.
LEVEL_498_POST_6=*growl* Balance must be restored. The Dark Lord must be destroyed.
LEVEL_498_POST_7=Find my soulstones. You need my power to help counter Umlaut's secret forms. 
LEVEL_498_POST_8=So said the rejected fifth member of Ninja Turtles. What makes you think we need your powers when you couldn't defend yourself against Umlaut earlier?
LEVEL_498_POST_9=What secrets? Hello? Snapper Bone? Darn it, Yeti, couldn't you hold your tongue? Understudy, what happened? Snapper Bone became motionless like a statue.
LEVEL_498_POST_10=We need to find his soulstones otherwise he won't move again.
LEVEL_498_POST_11=Black Wing, what did he meant when he said Umlaut secrets?
LEVEL_498_POST_12=I do not know anything else other than Umlaut is a sword fighter, mastered some dark mystic arts, and he is good at what he does, killing.
LEVEL_498_POST_13=I feel we are ill-prepared. Sojourner, Understudy, Black Wing, Greedy. While we push on, work together with Eternal to figure out these secrets.
LEVEL_501_PRE_1=*gasp*  In the shadows over there. It looks like a big human figure cat staring at me.
LEVEL_501_PRE_2=Ignore, Foxy. We don't have time to start a fight with an unknown enemy. We need to find the Acolyte Statue and Umlaut.
LEVEL_501_PRE_3=She is moving towards us. What is wrong with her? Was it something you said? 
LEVEL_501_PRE_4=Eyes forward, Foxy. If you keep giving her attention, you'll end up giving her an excuse to confront you.
LEVEL_501_PRE_5=*eek* Something slashed my face. *boff* Ouch. Something hit me.  OW, OW, OW. PLEASE STOP.
LEVEL_501_PRE_6=*DRINKS ARE ON YOU!*
LEVEL_501_PRE_7=Argh.
LEVEL_501_PRE_8=Thank you, Sojourner.
LEVEL_501_PRE_9=This doesn't change anything, you sleazy @#$%*.  Besides, I find cowardly attacks despicable.
LEVEL_501_PRE_10=*roar* You'sh cannot *hic* match *hic* my speed. You need more than toxins to getta better of me.
LEVEL_501_PRE_11=M-My potion barely affected her. She must be one of the Divine Beasts.
LEVEL_501_PRE_12=Guardian Hero, to you. And I heard you talking about the Acolyte Statue and Umlaut. As one of the Guardian Heroes, protector of these lands, I, White Tigress, will destroy you.
LEVEL_501_PRE_13=I will die before I let you touch her.
LEVEL_501_PRE_14=RAHHH.  *leaps forward* FOOLISH WEAKLING.
LEVEL_501_PRE_15=ARGH. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ME.
LEVEL_501_POST_1=*/panting/* Her skills are ridiculous. With attacks like that, we all should be dead. I guess her drunken state has affected her accuracy.
LEVEL_501_POST_2=What?! But I thought it was due to us being awesome?
LEVEL_501_POST_3=I smelled alcohol on her breath when she grabbed us. I doubt she fights well in that state.
LEVEL_501_POST_4=We are. *hic* Not done. I'veeee guarded the Acolyte Statue for thousands of years. I. *hic* I. *hic* I will die before I let demons like you get a hold of it.
LEVEL_501_POST_5=We are here to stop Umlaut. Listen, please sober up so we can tell you everything.
LEVEL_501_POST_6=Liar! Enough of this. When I come back, I'll kill you all. *dash*
LEVEL_501_POST_7=Mad stupid @#$%^. Just wait until I see her again.
LEVEL_501_POST_8=She went this way. Follow her.
LEVEL_504_PRE_1=Is that what I think it is?
LEVEL_504_PRE_2=The Statue of Draconian, here deep in the mountains?  This must be the place.
LEVEL_504_PRE_3=Wait. Where is the Acolyte Statue? It should be here too but I don't see it.
LEVEL_504_PRE_4=ARGHHHHHH.  You-u-u-u did this. *hic*
LEVEL_504_PRE_5=Foxy. Look there. The Acolyte Statue is in pieces. Destroyed.
LEVEL_504_PRE_6=Umlaut... It's definitely him... Wait, Cat Lady! We can explain!
LEVEL_504_PRE_7=*sobs* Congratulation, *hic* scums. Are you satisfied? The Dark Lord absorbed the power of the Acolyte Statue. There is nothing left.
LEVEL_504_PRE_8=You did this. This is all your fault... *smirk* So, I've decided. *hic* I will take you to my shack... To torture you. *giggle* Do it for aeons. Bring you to the brink of death.
LEVEL_504_PRE_9=Now. Just hang on.
LEVEL_504_PRE_10=You won't experience death.
LEVEL_504_PRE_11=Cat Lady, please! This is the drink talking!
LEVEL_504_PRE_12=And every time you are about to die, *hic* I will give you a small sample of my power. Reviving you just enough so I can repeat the process. *smirk* In time. When I feel you've suffered enough. *LoL* I will kill you! *Bwahahaha* You b%@#$!
LEVEL_504_POST_1=ARGHH. UGH.
LEVEL_504_POST_2=CALM HER DOWN. BIND HER.
LEVEL_504_POST_3=*despair* ra-a-ARRRGGHHHHHAOOOOWW.
LEVEL_504_POST_4=*LOL* SHE HAS GONE BERSERK. WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.
LEVEL_504_POST_5=*booming voice* WHITE TIGRESS.
LEVEL_504_POST_6=Snapper Bone?
LEVEL_504_POST_7=Guardian Hero. You have been drinking. You lived for thousands of years and, yet, you still cannot hold your liquor. We must help these heroes stop Umlaut, not destroy them.
LEVEL_504_POST_8=I hearrrd them talking about *hic* Umlaut and the Acolyte Statue. I *hic* was sure they were after its power.
LEVEL_504_POST_9=That's what we've been trying to tell you. We are here to stop Umlaut. Perhaps, if you never attacked us, we might have been able to make it here in time to stop him.
LEVEL_504_POST_10=If she never attacked you, you'll be dead. You are not ready to fight Umlaut. Even if you defeat him, he will eventually destroy you with his second and third secret form.
LEVEL_504_POST_11=UMLAUT HAS MORE THAN ONE FORM?
LEVEL_504_POST_12=Just when you think the Dark one himself couldn't be any more powerful. Thinking about it send chills down my spine.
LEVEL_504_POST_13=I'm sorry, brother. I need to *hic* sober up so I can join the fight. Find my Soulstones, heroes. You need my full power to aid you in this crusade.
LEVEL_504_POST_14=We must seek out Vermilion Priestess, another Guardian Hero. Her divine powers along with the Phoenix are strong enough to track Umlaut without alerting him. 
LEVEL_504_POST_15=Don't worry, Guardian Hero. We'll find them so you can unleash your true strength against those who deserve it.  Until then. Electroyeti?
LEVEL_504_POST_16=LOL.  Huh?
LEVEL_504_POST_17=Since you found this all to be a joke, you will carry White Tigress. She needs to rest until we gather her Soulstones.
LEVEL_504_POST_18=@#$%. 
LEVEL_507_PRE_1=Have you heard of Vermilion Priestess? A powerful woman, a real warrior. She is also a divine beast that has been protecting the Acolyte Statue with her magical power.
LEVEL_507_PRE_2=How do you know her?
LEVEL_507_PRE_3=As King of the Subterranean world, I must know who are my enemies and what is happening in this realm. To do this, I control an army of Molarks.
LEVEL_507_PRE_4=My Molarks are fighters and spies. Acting as my eyes and ears, they carefully move in the shadows to acquire anything and everything I need to know. Thanks to them, we learned about the Priestess.
LEVEL_507_PRE_5=They told me the Priestess has a magnificent amplitude for fighting and contributing to her team.
LEVEL_507_PRE_6=Did you know that she trained at the Secrets Armory run by the legendary Vermilion Birds priest warriors? 
LEVEL_507_PRE_7=Because she is a Guardian Hero, I believe she is a wise and strong woman with great leadership qualities. I've heard that her beauty easily surpasses the likes of Dragon Slayer.
LEVEL_507_PRE_8=Oi.
LEVEL_507_PRE_9=I really cannot wait to see her.
LEVEL_507_PRE_10=*bang*
LEVEL_507_PRE_11=Priestess?
LEVEL_507_PRE_12=Whoa. A superhero landing.
LEVEL_507_PRE_13=Sister. Welcome. Umlaut has absorbed one of the Acolyte Statue. We must stand together, now.
LEVEL_507_PRE_14=...
LEVEL_507_PRE_15=Sister? Verillion Priestess?
LEVEL_507_PRE_16=Is that her, Digger Mole? The wonder woman that you praised so much? She looks like a young girl.
LEVEL_507_PRE_17=*Whoosh* DESTRUCTOR DASH. *surge*
LEVEL_507_PRE_18=Oh my gosh that power looks insane!
LEVEL_507_PRE_19=She is possessed by Umlaut. Everyone, fighting formation.
LEVEL_507_PRE_20=PRIESTESS. YOU ARE A GUARDIAN HERO. LISTEN TO US.
LEVEL_507_PRE_21=It's no use! We must fight to wake her up.
LEVEL_507_POST_1=You will never stop the Dark Lord, Umlaut. Long live the Dark Lord, our savior. 
LEVEL_507_POST_2=PRIESTESS. WAKE UP.
LEVEL_507_POST_3=The Dark Lord will help you meet your maker. Follow me so I can take you on your way. *fly*
LEVEL_507_POST_4=Follow her! Something tells me we'll need all the Guardian Heroes' help to defeat Umlaut!
LEVEL_510_PRE_1=I see her. Keep running for she is about to land.
LEVEL_510_PRE_2=*panting* I can't take it. My body was not meant for running.
LEVEL_510_PRE_3=WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CITY? It was fine not too long ago.
LEVEL_510_PRE_4=Buildings destroyed. Broken stone floors. Fire. A sky that looks like it was scorched by Death.
LEVEL_510_PRE_5=No, this cannot be the work of Umlaut. He needs this place in-tact so he can easily find the Acolyte Statues. Something else did this.
LEVEL_510_PRE_6=Welcome to your final resting place.
LEVEL_510_PRE_7=Umlaut has no control over you. Fight him!
LEVEL_510_PRE_8=I do what I please. 
LEVEL_510_POST_1=What's going on? What happened.
LEVEL_510_POST_2=Priestess. You were being controlled by Umlaut.
LEVEL_510_POST_3=That's impossible! Yes, Umlaut controlled my mind 2,000 years ago, but since then I made many psychic incantations to protect myself. It's inconceivable that he broke all my spells.
LEVEL_510_POST_4=YOU AND UMLAUT ARE OVER 2,000 YEARS OLD?
LEVEL_510_POST_5=There is much you do not know about the Dark Lord.
LEVEL_510_POST_6=Sister. Can you stand? We are going to take the fight to Umlaut.
LEVEL_510_POST_7=Yes, but I have no energy. Please find my soulstones. The Guardian Heroes need to be at maximum strength to defeat Umlaut.
LEVEL_510_POST_8=*looks at Vermilion Priestess* Yes, mi-lady.
LEVEL_510_POST_9=Eh? Mi-lady?
LEVEL_510_POST_10=Please rest. You must conserve your strength until we find your soulstones.
LEVEL_510_POST_11=Why thank you, kind rat.
LEVEL_510_POST_12=Rat?
LEVEL_510_POST_13=I am relieved, but we are not safe. Abyss Dragon is free from his statue. His mind does not appear to be his own. We must stop him.
LEVEL_510_POST_14=Tell me more about Abyss Dragon.
LEVEL_513_PRE_1=Insane. The weather is going crazy. That Dragon's power must be off the charts!
LEVEL_513_PRE_2=*Roar* Reeejaaaakuuuuuu.  Zaaaaaaalaaakembaaa.
LEVEL_513_PRE_3=Understudy, what did he say?
LEVEL_513_PRE_4=I have no idea. I do not understand this dialect.
LEVEL_513_PRE_5=He is speaking in ancient Draconian tongue. Don't worry, I'm sober now.
LEVEL_513_PRE_6=Dark Dracul. Can you speak this?
LEVEL_513_PRE_7=Whaaaatssss? Theeeeeeis too old for meeeee.
LEVEL_513_PRE_8=He said our time has come to an end. We will die on this ground.
LEVEL_513_PRE_9=Doookaaaseeeryuuuuuzaku. Raaaaaaaadie suuulaguuuuu.
LEVEL_513_PRE_10=WHAT?
LEVEL_513_PRE_11=Oooooozamelaaaki umba. Deeemajenareku.
LEVEL_513_PRE_12=Can you speak this language?
LEVEL_513_PRE_13=All Guardian Heroes can speak the language. Abyss said everyone will be destroyed in honor of Umlaut.
LEVEL_513_PRE_14=That son of a @#$%. I knew Umlaut did something.
LEVEL_513_PRE_15=I told him that he is being controlled and we are his true guardians. 
LEVEL_513_PRE_16=*Deep Roar*
LEVEL_513_PRE_17=Take cover! He is going to attack.
LEVEL_513_PRE_18=Then we must take him down.
LEVEL_513_POST_1=*ALMIGHTY ROAR* 
LEVEL_513_POST_2=Omg, we've pissed him off.
LEVEL_513_POST_3=ORAMA EEEJAAANAA GOONDAAAREFUEEEE.
LEVEL_513_POST_4=What did he say?
LEVEL_513_POST_5=He said we have forfeited our lives and will return when he restore his powers.
LEVEL_513_POST_6=Rejaaahaaabuulakeee!
LEVEL_513_POST_7=Eeejanaikaaaa Ruzaaaaki 
LEVEL_513_POST_8=Gonnnndaaaaaaaa
LEVEL_513_POST_9=*ROAR*  *Vanish*
LEVEL_513_POST_10=What the @#$% just happened?
LEVEL_513_POST_11=We all tried to reason with Abyss Dragon, but he doesn't believe Umlaut is controlling him. Now he is gone.
LEVEL_513_POST_12=Guardian Heroes, we cannot stop Abyss Dragon and Umlaut by ourselves. We need your help. We clearly cannot do this without you.
LEVEL_513_POST_13=With you all by our sides, we can conquer Umlaut and restore peace to all realms.
LEVEL_513_POST_14=Eternal? What's wrong?
LEVEL_513_POST_15=The endgame is drawing near. I believe we will meet Umlaut soon.
LEVEL_513_POST_16=How do you know? Did you look into the future?
LEVEL_513_POST_17=No, I am not Dr. Strange. It's not difficult to see that we are very close to Umlaut. 
LEVEL_513_POST_18=It's been more than two years since we've started this quest. I cannot believe the time is almost here.
LEVEL_513_POST_19=Then we shouldn't be late to our date.  UMLAUT, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME, KNOW THIS. WE ARE COMING FOR YOU. AND WHEN WE MEET, WE WILL DESTROY YOU.
LEVEL_513_POST_20=*Big booming voice fills the sky* COMEEEE.
LEVEL_513_POST_21=Oh @#$%!
LEVEL_513_POST_22=GLADLY. Heroes. Our destiny awaits. March forward.

#Chapter 28 Release 2.21.0
LEVEL_514_PRE_1=What happened to the Fort? It's as if a herd of meteorites descended and destroyed it. But it wasn't like that earlier today. 
LEVEL_514_PRE_2=Umlaut. Is there no line that he won't cross?
LEVEL_514_PRE_3=I'd never imagined that he would desecrate this land. I will not let him continue such heinous acts any longer.
LEVEL_514_PRE_4=I think I know what Umlaut is after. He must have learned about the last Acolyte statue.
LEVEL_514_PRE_5=There is one more?
LEVEL_514_PRE_6=*ROAR-R-R-R-R-RRR*
LEVEL_514_PRE_7=I've had enough of this. Abyss, I'll show you "real" power.
LEVEL_514_PRE_8=YES. Straight to action! Let's kill that @#$%^*!
LEVEL_514_PRE_9=*ROAR-R-R-R-R-RRR*
LEVEL_514_POST_1=He is down! Take Abyss so we can - *whoosh* What the?
LEVEL_514_POST_2=Feel the fury of the desert.
LEVEL_514_POST_3=Anubis.
LEVEL_514_POST_4=Foolish heroes. You know nothing. May the Dark Lord have his way with you before striping your souls from your bodies. 
LEVEL_514_POST_5=Abyss. Orreeenaaguu.
LEVEL_514_POST_6=*ROAR-R-R* *poof*
LEVEL_514_POST_7=Dragon Lady. We need to save Anubis and Abyss. They do not know what they are doing.
LEVEL_514_POST_8=*sigh* I'm getting a little tired of playing "Captain Save a Hero". 
LEVEL_514_POST_9=Do not lose focus as your team needs you. Umlaut doesn't yet know that the answers he seeks lie at the Coliseum so let's get over there before he does.
LEVEL_514_POST_10=Then we leave now. Heroes, march forward.
LEVEL_517_PRE_1=It was here, my love. We said to each other that we would roam the stars forever. Now I stand in the last Flame of Argos, its exquisite heat warms my heart and allows me to connect with you once more.
LEVEL_517_PRE_2=What the @#$% is she talking about?
LEVEL_517_PRE_3=Anubis. Please recognise my voice and come back to us. 
LEVEL_517_PRE_4=Love. Despair. So much pain, so many horrors. My love. Upon the deity of Space & Time and with the Flame of Argos, watch me transcend all to bring you back to the realm of the living. Demonic entities, I'll borrow thee. Heavenly knights, I'll besiege thee.
LEVEL_517_PRE_5=Something is appearing in front of her. No! We must stop her! She is mistaking the hand of Death as her old companion!
LEVEL_517_PRE_6=Power and light deliverence and all. Power and grace forever and all... Love and..  *splash* *GASP*
LEVEL_517_PRE_7=Flame gone. Problem solved.
LEVEL_517_PRE_8=Lol! I cannot believe you found that bucket of water and poured it over her, Yeti.
LEVEL_517_PRE_9=ARGHHH. You-u-u-u-u IM-M-M-M-BE-E-E-CILE. HOW DARE YOU?
LEVEL_517_PRE_10=And now we have your @#$%&*^ attention.
LEVEL_517_PRE_11=That was the last Flame of Argos... I CAN NEVER GET MY LOVE BACK FROM THE DEAD NOW. UNACCEPTABLE, UNACCEPTABLE, UNACCEPTABLE.
LEVEL_517_PRE_12=Oh @#$%, she is pissed!
LEVEL_517_PRE_13=ARGHHHH.
LEVEL_517_POST_1=I... I cannot fight when I'm this wet and furious.
LEVEL_517_POST_2=... I didn't expect her to say that.
LEVEL_517_POST_3=Imbecile. Mock me now but mark my word. I've seen your future and your time is coming.
LEVEL_517_POST_4=Anubis, it's me! 
LEVEL_517_POST_5=You all will fall against the might of the Dark Lord! *vanished*
LEVEL_517_POST_6=We cannot let this continue. Let's end this nightmare once and for all.
LEVEL_517_POST_7=Let's crack some heads!
LEVEL_517_POST_8=Let's not.
LEVEL_520_PRE_1=Priestess. Finally, you have come to your senses?
LEVEL_520_PRE_2=Anubis. I'm sorry, but here on this Battery is where you will fall and return to your former self.
LEVEL_520_PRE_3=Priestess. Why throw your life away so recklessly? Depart from these... heroes. You are a priestess and work at the chapel, but now you shall be a God with me.
LEVEL_520_PRE_4=I only care to protect the lands and the people that I love.
LEVEL_520_PRE_5=Love? Then die for you have missed out on immortality. 
LEVEL_520_POST_1=CURSE YOU. CURSE YOU. CURSE YOU.
LEVEL_520_POST_2=Why is she not back to normal like the others?
LEVEL_520_POST_3=Everyone, hold her down until Vermillion complete her spell.
LEVEL_520_POST_4=badaaareifuuuumeio. badaaareifuuuumeio. badaaareifuuuumeio.
LEVEL_520_POST_5=CURSE YOU. CURSE YOU ALL-L-L-L-L.
LEVEL_520_POST_6=Lol! You know what's funny?
LEVEL_520_POST_7=What?
LEVEL_520_POST_8=What she said before the fight was frigging awesome! "Then die for you have missed out on immortality." @#$%. That was a good line!
LEVEL_520_POST_9=Just shut up and hold her.
LEVEL_520_POST_10=badaaareifuuuumeio. ERIDUUU. *bright light*
LEVEL_520_POST_11=ARRGHH...  Huh? Where am I? Guardians Heroes?  What happened?
LEVEL_520_POST_12=You are out of your statue. How are you feeling?
LEVEL_520_POST_13=I feel strange, exhausted, and exasperated.
LEVEL_520_POST_14=Umlaut cast a powerful spell on you that allowed him to control your mind. We must move, quickly. Can you stand?
LEVEL_520_POST_15=I can.  But I need my soulstones.
LEVEL_520_POST_16=Take Yeti's soul. You did it before to one of the enemies. Everyone is tired of Yeti's blabber month.
LEVEL_520_POST_17=No. Did I do that? Then I must release that soul at once. I vowed never to take a life.
LEVEL_520_POST_18=Unfortunately, Umlaut doesn't care about anyone's life. Come. We'll explain while we travel.
LEVEL_523_PRE_1=It's in ruins, but this Coliseum looks magnificent. I could only imagine what it used to be like in its heydays. 
LEVEL_523_PRE_2=Long ago, this place was a testing ground to see the strength of both man and beast without death. Even children use to come here to be inspired, which helped them to become a mighty warrior when they reached the required age of outdoor combat.
LEVEL_523_PRE_3=Halt. Step no further. Who goes there? 
LEVEL_523_PRE_4=H-Hello. We are the heroes of this lands. We fight for peace and prosperity for all.
LEVEL_523_PRE_5=And who do you fight that brings evil to this land?
LEVEL_523_PRE_6=Oh? Aren't you aware of what is happening outside?
LEVEL_523_PRE_7=I have not stepped out of these ruins for as long as I remember.  I deserve to stay here, a prison for my failure.
LEVEL_523_PRE_8=Well now, whatever you did cannot be that bad. We can help each other. Can you step out of the shadows so we can see you?  I'd like us to start again by formally introducing each other if you don't mind?  
LEVEL_523_PRE_9=*heavy steps*
LEVEL_523_PRE_10=OMG.
LEVEL_523_PRE_11=Oh @#$%!
LEVEL_523_PRE_12=I am Andragonus. Do I repulse you? I thought you were "brave" heroes?
LEVEL_523_PRE_13=A Draconian...
LEVEL_523_PRE_14=@#$%. He reminds me of Umlaut!
LEVEL_523_PRE_15=Umlaut? Outside? I see. You must be after the Seal. You want the ultimate power to rule all.
LEVEL_523_PRE_16=Ultimate power? What do you -
LEVEL_523_PRE_17=You will never learn the secrets of the Seal. I must stop you and your evil scheme.
LEVEL_523_POST_1=Step back. I care not to fight any longer. You will never receive the Seal.
LEVEL_523_POST_2=Andragonus. Stop. We are your fellow guardian. Why aren't you in your statue? You must be confused because you are not possessed. Snap out of it.
LEVEL_523_POST_3=I will never aid you. 
LEVEL_523_POST_4=Ah. Blasted Draconian, your life ends here! I will never forget your face, Umlaut!
LEVEL_523_POST_5=*runs into the shadows*
LEVEL_523_POST_6=Dwarf, what are you doing?! That is NOT Umlaut. You have gone mad.
LEVEL_523_POST_7=Stupid woman! That IS Umlaut! Me told you ma stories. You stupid kids don't know anything.
LEVEL_523_POST_8=I have had enough of your lies. When this is over, we'll discuss whether you are still fit to be part of this team. 
LEVEL_523_POST_9=Bah. Ignorant young fool. You know nothing. Judging my eyes and mind? You have no idea how long I have lived. I've seen and done things before you were even born.
LEVEL_526_PRE_1=*heavy landing* 
LEVEL_526_PRE_2=Looks like he won't let us go.
LEVEL_526_PRE_3=*RO-O-O-O-O-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-RRRR* 
LEVEL_526_PRE_4=OMG, THAT ROAR WAS DEAFENING AS @#$%! 
LEVEL_526_PRE_5=Bring him down! He is intentionally delaying us from reaching Umlaut.
LEVEL_526_POST_1=Badaaareifuuuumeio. ERIDUUU. *bright light*
LEVEL_526_POST_2=Daaaaakirooku.
LEVEL_526_POST_3=Muudoou. Hakuri hakuri. Damgraduuu.
LEVEL_526_POST_4=Joooomungafree ra duuuunaaaaa.
LEVEL_526_POST_5=What did he say?
LEVEL_526_POST_6=He said he would help us defeat Umlaut, and he knows the reason why Umlaut needed the Acolyte statues. Umlaut has been gathering the blood of the Guardians to unlock the Overking's Seal. Pieces of the Overking's Seal were hidden inside each Acolyte Statue.
LEVEL_526_POST_7=Vampire? Ah, Blade!
LEVEL_526_POST_8=Shut up, Yeti. Priestess, what is the Overking's Seal?
LEVEL_526_POST_9=The seal locks away a legendary item of power. Power strong enough to change the balance of good and evil within this realm. This is all I know.
LEVEL_526_POST_10=At least now we know why Umlaut possessed the Guardians. 
LEVEL_526_POST_11=I think I know what Umlaut wants.
LEVEL_526_POST_12=What is it?
LEVEL_526_POST_13=We must hurry. If Umlaut succeeds, all is lost!
LEVEL_529_PRE_1=I know why you are here. You are here to disrupt the ceremony of the one that will bring peace to this world. No. I won't allow you to do that. 
LEVEL_529_PRE_2=You cannot stop him. He is too powerful now.
LEVEL_529_PRE_3=Too powerful? We cannot let him get any stronger.
LEVEL_529_PRE_4=You know nothing. There is good in him. He will change and fulfil the wish! My decision was not wrong.
LEVEL_529_PRE_5=What are you talking about?
LEVEL_529_PRE_6=I won't let you continue. I won't let you pass. Your road end with me.
LEVEL_529_POST_1=How dare you. How dare you strike me.
LEVEL_529_POST_2=Listen. Umlaut is not who you think he is. He is corrupted. He has killed thousands. His evil armies spread across the land like locust. We cannot let him succeed. 
LEVEL_529_POST_3=In his mind, he believes he is omnipotent and benevolent.
LEVEL_529_POST_4=Black Wing? Is that you?
LEVEL_529_POST_5=It's been awhile, my friend. You must listen to her for she and everyone here are my friends.
LEVEL_529_POST_6=If what you say is true, then he must be stopped. He is unworthy!
LEVEL_529_POST_7=What does he mean by, "unworthy"? What is going on?
LEVEL_529_POST_8=No time! The ceremony is almost complete. I can feel the Powers of the Ancients shifting. That means he has succeeded in opening the Overking's Seal and about to receive unlimited power!
LEVEL_529_POST_9=Omg.
LEVEL_529_POST_10=I'm sorry that I have delayed your efforts. If it wasn't for me, you would have reached him in time.
LEVEL_529_POST_11=Which way should we go?
LEVEL_529_POST_12=Over there! We must move quickly! We cannot face him head-on. While he concentrates on the ceremony, we'll all blindside him with a rush attack!
LEVEL_529_POST_13=Let's go!
LEVEL_532_PRE_1=Quickly. We are almost there! We must stop the ceremony. We must - *barghh* 
LEVEL_532_PRE_2=*gasp* ANDRAGONUS. What hit you? He is knocked out.
LEVEL_532_PRE_3=U-u-u-u-u-u... U-u-u-u-u! 
LEVEL_532_PRE_4=Yeti, stop tugging my clothes. 
LEVEL_532_PRE_5=U-u-u-u-u-UMLAUT.
LEVEL_532_PRE_6=You-u-u. How did you know? 
LEVEL_532_PRE_7=You have done enough, Andragonus. For 3 long years, you insects been a thorn in my side. No longer. Now, it's useless delaying the inevitable for I am chaos and eternal; I can never be defeated. You all will feel my wrath.
LEVEL_532_PRE_8=Oh my gosh! It's him.
LEVEL_532_PRE_9=Finally, Dark Lord. We meet face to face. I've been waiting for this day more than you know.
LEVEL_532_PRE_10=Misguided heroes. Don't you understand that I wish for peace to all realms, especially when I acquire the Power of the Ancients?
LEVEL_532_PRE_11=You want powers above all powers. Become the King of Kings.
LEVEL_532_PRE_12=Now tell me. Why do you continue to resist? There is no freedom from me, there is only freedom through me. Come, join me and together, we'll bring peace to this realm and beyond.
LEVEL_532_PRE_13=Umlaut. In the name of the fallen, the innocent, and all that stood against you, we will defeat you! 
LEVEL_532_PRE_14=Heroes, we forged this fellowship because we have a common enemy. But things have changed, we have changed, we've become a family and done incredible things together.
LEVEL_532_PRE_15=Today, we are no longer heroes. Today, WE ARE "DRAGONSOUL", AND OUR TIME TO SHINE HAS COME. SO, DRAGONSOUL, SAVE THIS FRIGGING WORLD. DESTROY UMLAUT! FIGHT FOR FREEDOM!
LEVEL_532_PRE_16=YE-E-E-E-E-EAH!
LEVEL_532_PRE_17=Fools. I am the rocks of the eternal shore. CRASH AGAINST ME AND BE BROKEN for I fear no one!
LEVEL_532_POST_1=It-it's over. We've won?!
LEVEL_532_POST_2=I've laid waste to over 1,000 bugs for this moment. Surely, this must be a dream?
LEVEL_532_POST_3=Mother. Father. Finally, you can rest in peace.
LEVEL_532_POST_4=We are freaking awesome! Bwahahahahaha! BWAHHAHAHAHA.
LEVEL_532_POST_5=YETI, LOOK OUT. 
LEVEL_532_POST_6=BWAAHHHHH!
LEVEL_532_POST_7=BEHIND YOU! 
LEVEL_532_POST_8=UCKK.
LEVEL_532_POST_9=NOOOOOO. Yeti. Y-you skewed him with your sword.
LEVEL_532_POST_10=Do you honestly think that you could defeat me? I cannot be touched, I cannot be harmed. Watch me and tremble for you are leagues beneath my level.
LEVEL_532_POST_11=*crying* Monster. Y-YOU A MONSTER, UMLAUT.
LEVEL_532_POST_12=... He is dying. Put him down so we can tend to him... Please. 
LEVEL_532_POST_13=Your soul abilities are limited and finite. The skills you've harnessed amount to none. It's inevitable, inevitable, INEVITABLE. *smack*
LEVEL_532_POST_14=Ugh. Fool! Who dares strike to claim dominion over me - *multiple special arrows aim at Umlaut* Huh?
LEVEL_532_POST_15=Disappear.
LEVEL_532_POST_16=*Multiple explosion* UGH. DO YOU THINK THIS WILL HARM ME? BLASHPHEMER!
LEVEL_532_POST_17=*Grabs Electroyeti* Everyone, huddle close together. PHANTOM VORTEX. *our heroes vanished within a giant whirlwind*
LEVEL_532_POST_18=Vermin. There is no place you can run, there is no place you can hide for I have the Seal that I need to complete my ascension. Wait. *searching* It's gone. THIEF! I WILL FIND YOU, BLACK WING. I'LL HUNT YOU LIKE A TYRANT FROM HELL. You are all my prey.
LEVEL_532_POST_19=We are a couple of miles away from Umlaut. I've healed Electroyeti while we travelled here, he will be ok.
LEVEL_532_POST_20=I don't understand. Power of the Ancient. Andragonus' confusing words. Umlaut seeking for true power. Nothing makes sense. 
LEVEL_532_POST_21=Umlaut completed half of the ceremony, so his new powers are incomplete, and he won't be able to complete it without this Seal. I stole it from him when I struck his face. This seal unlocks the Power of the Ancients.
LEVEL_532_POST_22=Black Wing. I-I underestimated you. You are amazing.
LEVEL_532_POST_23=And Ancient Dwarf was not wrong. Andragonus IS Umlaut. Andragonus is "Umlaut Andragonus the First", and Umlaut is "Umlaut Andragonus the Fifth". Umlaut the Fifth is the fifth generation in Andragonus' Draconian bloodline. 
LEVEL_532_POST_24=WHAT?!

#Chapter 29 Release 2.22.0
LEVEL_533_PRE_1=Ka-boom! Kill'em! Kill'em all with fire. Kill the enemies, kill the bots! I've seen the light. I know the truth!
LEVEL_533_PRE_2=I have no idea what you're talking about, but I'm with you, Yeti. Whether it's a ferocious dragon or big cats, anyone that stands in our way will fall. Wait a minute, where are we going?!
LEVEL_533_PRE_3=Time freeze.
LEVEL_533_PRE_4=Thank you for slowing down time, Enchanter.
LEVEL_533_PRE_5=You have 1 minute, make it count.
LEVEL_533_PRE_6=Black Wing, tell us everything. The Acolytes, the Andragonus family, the Power of Ancients. Why is Umlaut still alive? This confusion ends now.
LEVEL_533_PRE_7=Long ago, this realm was ruled by the Draconians. Lands divided by different Draconian families, the Andragonus family were the royals of that demented era led by the Umlaut Andragonus the First.
LEVEL_533_PRE_8=Andragonus wielded the Power of the Ancient like a mighty hammer, laying down the law, maintaining peace and balance across the realm. He did this together with Abyss Dragon and Anubis Dragon, a team they called themselves the Acolyte Trinity. Sadly, we all know that with power comes -
LEVEL_533_PRE_9=Spidey sense tingling! I've seen the light and truth of this electronic world! Re-spawned! I've re-spawned.
LEVEL_533_PRE_10=Dammit, Yeti. I'm happy that you are alive and well, but do not interrupt. It was this kind of attitude that almost got you killed in the first place!
LEVEL_533_PRE_11=The souls of those beasts are intertwined, the loss of one will send the other one crazy! Crazy like unstable's mom! Crazy like the players who are controlling me! Do you know they look at our multiverse through a tiny screen that they touch with their bacteria infested fingers? Spray antibacterial spray on yourself, folks. Stay clean!
LEVEL_533_PRE_12=WTF, Yeti. Stop pretending like you have broken the 4th wall. Sorry, Black Wing, continue.
LEVEL_533_PRE_13=With great power comes a terrible price for the longer you wield the Power of the Ancient, the more it will claim your soul.
LEVEL_533_PRE_14=Andragonus realised this and determined that since he has already exhausted his time with the Power of the Ancient, he must hand over the power and mantle to another bearer to prevent it going into evil hands.
LEVEL_533_PRE_15=Andragonus is weak! Weak I'd say! He is nothing compared to me for I've seen the light. I was about to enter it before the gaming gods laid down the law! I received some new tips from them, baby!
LEVEL_533_PRE_16=Dangnamit, Yeti! Stop your madness. If you continue to act this way, I'll have no choice but to use a spell to zip your lips! Black Wing, please make the story shorter. Yeti seems to be losing it and time is running out.
LEVEL_533_PRE_17=He passed the power to his eldest daughter. It droved her mad. She created anarchy and chaos throughout the realm and organisational fronts before self-combusting in a blaze of fire. Andragonus then passed the mantle to his youngest son. For a moment, all seemed good because he was young, able to take the pressure. Unfortunately, he felt the full wrath of the power, just like his sibling. 
LEVEL_533_PRE_18=After a series of failures, the Power of the Ancients wiped out half of Andragonus' family. However, it still needs a bearer. The catastrophe caused Andragonus to wallow in self-hate, pity and despair to the point he imprisoned himself in the Acolyte statue in hope to wake up when a chosen one is to bring balance to the realm arrives.
LEVEL_533_PRE_19=Times up. Sorry, I couldn't hold the spell any longer.
LEVEL_533_PRE_20=M-monster. No time will prevent me from ending your life.
LEVEL_533_PRE_21=I'm sorry. You are?
LEVEL_533_PRE_22=Do you align yourself with that monster from the Abyss? The one that flooded villages and killed thousands in thy wake? The locals warned me about you, you must be stopped. 
LEVEL_533_PRE_23=You mean Abyss Dragon? Well, obviously, there appears to be some kind of misunderstanding. Let me expl -
LEVEL_533_PRE_24=Save your precious lies to someone that cares, demon! In the name of those villagers, I'm ending all of you.
LEVEL_533_POST_1=*whisper* I underestimated their strength and I may need help to defeat them. Ok. I'll give them some fighting words. better say this. *deep breath* Ugh! Y-y-you f-f-filthy old Dragon excrement! One versus 85 plus demons is unfair! I-I'll be back with some reinforcement to even the odds against you and the evil lord.
LEVEL_533_POST_2=Evil Lord? Listen. We are fighting for the same cause and I'm sure you don't want to fight me for I don't want to fight you. You must come with us for it's not safe here. Eventually, Umlaut and his followers will catch up and either mind-control, kill you or worse.
LEVEL_533_POST_3=I-I-I don't trust you, people. You say that you had Umlaut b-b-beat? I refuse to believe that. There could be two hundred of you, there is no collective power strong enough to take on the Dark Lord, but I will figure out a way to beat him!
LEVEL_533_POST_4=You misunderstand -
LEVEL_533_POST_5=I'll be back, demons. I'll swear I will take you all down. *runs away*
LEVEL_533_POST_6=Black Wing. Who is she?
LEVEL_533_POST_7=She is the Violet Outlaw. A lone-hero that is on the same mission as us.
LEVEL_533_POST_8=Well, we must get her on our side.
LEVEL_533_POST_9=Forget about her for now. I fear the Dark Lord is catching up with us... and I fear that he is not alone.
LEVEL_533_POST_10=Where shall we go?
LEVEL_533_POST_11=We go East! We are on the run so we must stay within this forest for now. Umlaut and this key are connected, so in order to destroy it, we must get it far away from him as possible.
LEVEL_533_POST_12=I'd take it destroying the key is the only way to seal the Power of the Ancient forever and truly defeat Umlaut. Ok, let's move!
LEVEL_533_POST_13=Ok, follow me.
LEVEL_536_PRE_1=Demons. I will send you back to the fire from once you came. You all deserve pain. Get over here so I can thrust my claws into your abdominal and turn you into a corpse.
LEVEL_536_PRE_2=Corpse? I died once and saw the %$^&@&£^% light. I'll tell you the truth. Maintenance! Maintenance everywhere! You are just a glitch in this make-believe world! Just a glitch and I am Neo!
LEVEL_536_PRE_3=Chill, Yeti! I have no idea what you are blabbering about. Maybe your insides were not the only thing that Umlaut's screwed up. 
LEVEL_536_PRE_4=Curse you, demon. This realm is dying, but you all be dead long before that happens.  I, Venom, will guarantee it!
LEVEL_536_POST_1=UgghhhhhH!  You will be a corpse, I swear.
LEVEL_536_POST_2=You love saying that. Maybe you and Vulture Dragon should become friends!
LEVEL_536_POST_3=You mock me, freak? When I come back, your head will be at the end of my claw. *run into the shadows*
LEVEL_536_POST_4=He is gone...  This is getting stranger and stranger.
LEVEL_536_POST_5=VERMINS-S-S-S. YOU DARE RUN FROM ME?? I WILL CHASE YOU TO THE END OF THIS REALM.
LEVEL_536_POST_6=Oh !@#$. Umlaut is near! You all heard that?
LEVEL_536_POST_7=Quickly. We must move! Hurry!
LEVEL_539_PRE_1=Something is wrong. The air smells foul with death. The plants around us are withering too quickly...  Oh no.
LEVEL_539_PRE_2=You are scaring me, Black Wing. How can you be scared?
LEVEL_539_PRE_3=EVERYONE, FIGHTING FORMATION. HE IS HERE.
LEVEL_539_PRE_4=Who??
LEVEL_539_PRE_5=THE SINISTER ASSAILANT.
LEVEL_539_PRE_6=RAHHHHHHHH. *sound of air suction*
LEVEL_539_PRE_7=It's you!
LEVEL_539_PRE_8=Thy Sands of Time is up. I am hither to take thou all aroint to the house of lamentation. Death is just a pipe dream for I'll take thou beyond all darkness and to the Lands of the Damned where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy mind shall shrivel within the tree of Stinx.
LEVEL_539_PRE_9=It was you! I remember it well. Last year, you took off the heads of the Belligerent Hags. You ambushed us on numerous occasions.
LEVEL_539_PRE_10=You also tricked us to collect all the Greenish Lanterns for you.
LEVEL_539_PRE_11=Heroes. You are correct. All those times, you did fought against the Sinister Assailant but you only fought against his projection. Since you collected the Greenish Lanterns to save those children, you gave him enough strength to bring him into our realm. Now we must push him back to the land of the dead.
LEVEL_539_PRE_12=Fred! You came back! HEY. Don't anyone touch him! He is a loyal servant from back in the days. His name is Fred -
LEVEL_539_PRE_13=*breathes out smoke from mouth* ahhhh... Haha.
LEVEL_539_PRE_14=ANDRAGONUS. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY THE DRACONIAN ERA ENDED? HE IS THE REASON WHY.
LEVEL_539_PRE_15=What?!
LEVEL_539_PRE_16=He is not Fred! The Sinister Assailant secretly kill everyone in an attempt to capture the Power of the Ancients! He killed all the Draconians and single-handedly brought an end to that era in his lust for power!
LEVEL_539_PRE_17=No. He was a loyal servant in my family for generations. That cannot be true!
LEVEL_539_PRE_18=Lol. Fred? MINE NAME IS SINISTER. And, Black Wing. I'll claim thee first.
LEVEL_539_POST_1=*heavy breathing* Lol... No matter. Thou all are nearly dead and I dispatch where I would. I've killed the Draconians of the old and Andragonus and Umlaut is the only ones left in this realm.
LEVEL_539_POST_2=I shall bring this realm to darkness as a hole opening within a glass where all shall gaze into its emptiness. I shall blast all rivers with the blood of beasts and sprinkle this forest with the entrails of man.
LEVEL_539_POST_3=*heavy breathing* Damn you, Fred! We treated you well! We trusted you.
LEVEL_539_POST_4=Lol. Corky fool. I am not he that thou regard. The time hath join for thy perpetual wink is long overdue.
LEVEL_539_POST_5=*step in front of Andragonus* You mess-s-s-s with-mi kind-d-d will be the death-h-h-h of you.
LEVEL_539_POST_6=A young Draconian? Lol. Doth thy not see death when it stands ere thou? Die, Draconians, die - *shock* ARGHHHHH.
LEVEL_539_POST_7=Curse you, spirit. My claw can cut anything!
LEVEL_539_POST_8=ARGHHHHHH. *vanish in a cloud of smoke*
LEVEL_539_POST_9=You stupid heroes. I could have killed you anytime, but I wanted to see what you could do.
LEVEL_539_POST_10=*heavy breathing* I hope... you can see... that we do not belong to Umlaut.
LEVEL_539_POST_11=Your judgement will come soon, heroes. Violet Outlaw and I will decide your fate. *runs into the shadows*
LEVEL_539_POST_12=I cannot believe that we are still alive...
LEVEL_539_POST_13=But the arrival of the Sinister Assailant means that Umlaut is near... We are running out of options. We may need to fight him.
LEVEL_539_POST_14=Why don't we tell Umlaut about Sinister so they can turn against each other?
LEVEL_539_POST_15=Do you honestly think Umlaut will listen to us? Black Wing. We are out of time. 
LEVEL_539_POST_16=We have one chance... We must go to the Tomb of Ends. It's within the ruins near here. The tomb contains distinctive properties that should server the connection between Umlaut and the key. If my theory is correct, we would be able to destroy the key there no matter how close Umlaut is to us.
LEVEL_539_POST_17=In other words, let's go to the dead or drop-zone. Brrring brrring! Leave your phones behind for you will get no reception!
LEVEL_539_POST_18=That's it, I've had it with you. SILENCARTO *bang*
LEVEL_539_POST_19=Mmmm! MMMMMM.
LEVEL_539_POST_20=That will keep you quiet for the next 20 minutes. No more 4th wall acting from you for a while.
LEVEL_539_POST_21=I hope you know what you are doing, Understudy. Let's go.
LEVEL_542_PRE_1=I told you I'll be back, and I've brought my friend.
LEVEL_542_PRE_2=What a strange pairing.
LEVEL_542_PRE_3=No stranger than you idiots! You may not be sided with Umlaut but we need to test you. See if you are strong enough to take him on.
LEVEL_542_PRE_4=E-e-enough t-t-talk. We going to take all of you out. You cannot take on the might of both of us. Fall under his claw and my bullets!
LEVEL_542_PRE_5=Oh. Do you have a have a stutter?
LEVEL_542_PRE_6=ONLY WHEN I AM N-N-NERVOUS. HOW D-DARE YOU MENTION IT. WE'RE GOING TO FINISH YOU, RIGHT HERE.
LEVEL_542_PRE_7=Ok. Logic just went out of the window. Dragonsoul, let's kick their puny butts.
LEVEL_542_POST_1=*heavy breathing*  Too much. They are too much.
LEVEL_542_POST_2=Violet, I've failed you. I don't know what you think of me now. Word not come to either mind or voice. I can only beg your forgiveness, and hope for your heart to listen to my own somehow, someplace... 
LEVEL_542_POST_3=You are not dating, are you?
LEVEL_542_POST_4=It appears that you are not as weak as it seems.
LEVEL_542_POST_5=No, we are not. We've grown over the years. The bungling heroes that left their home many moons ago are not the same people that stand before you today. We are powerful, grown exponentially strong. We are capable of taking on anything, taking on Umlaut.
LEVEL_542_POST_6=But you two are pretty powerful too. We need another long-range counter and a close quarter fighters in our team. Please join us. Together, we'll finish Umlaut and free this realm.
LEVEL_542_POST_7=Umlaut is a monster. I've followed his trail within the shadows for a long time. He is not easy to defeat. I thought you were with him when I saw you aligned with those monsters over there.
LEVEL_542_POST_8=We are not the monsters you think. Umlaut controlled our minds. He controlled most of our minds until we met Dragon Lady and her team of heroes.
LEVEL_542_POST_9=You can trust them. If you have been following Umlaut for all this time, you should know about us, Guardian Heroes. To have us together like this, it's only logical that we are all here for a higher cause, the cause of defeating Umlaut before he annihilates this world.
LEVEL_542_POST_10=Yes, we've heard of you and your heroic deeds.  Ok. We'll help you.  Violet just wanted to test you after I reported to her what I've learned about you earlier. Please gather our SoulStones. You know what to do.
LEVEL_542_POST_11=With so many fine warriors, it's inconceivable how Umlaut can defeat us all. But do not underestimate him. Let's finish this. Black Wing, lead the way.
LEVEL_545_PRE_1=Listen-n-n-n to me-e-e-e.  I do lack to compose a deal with thou.
LEVEL_545_PRE_2=Go on...
LEVEL_545_PRE_3=Grant me that key and I shall compose all thy problems hie away-y-y-y.
LEVEL_545_PRE_4=What do you mean?
LEVEL_545_PRE_5=I shall finish him, the Dark Lord. I shall finish Umlaut. Thou all crave to go home, do not thou? Tired are thee warriors. Tired of endless fighting. What quantity enemies thou hast killed since thou've started this conquest?
LEVEL_545_PRE_6=Five million, two hundred and sixty-five thousand, five hundred an -
LEVEL_545_PRE_7=LoL! Gosh dang, Yeti!
LEVEL_545_PRE_8=This is the deal. Thou heroes hie back to thy love ones and I shall leave thou and thy issues and friend alone. I shall go conquer Umlaut and bring peace back to the realm. Thou shall hie thy way and I shall hie mine way. Just grant me that key to make it befall.
LEVEL_545_PRE_9=No deal.
LEVEL_545_PRE_10=What?!
LEVEL_545_PRE_11=We know all about the key and the Power of the Ancient.
LEVEL_545_PRE_12=Whaaa-A-A-T?!
LEVEL_545_PRE_13=We will finish you!
LEVEL_545_PRE_14=HUHHHHHHHH. *power up*
LEVEL_545_PRE_15=And send you back to heck!
LEVEL_545_POST_1=Damn thou, heroes. Thou shall be sorry. This shall not be forgotten. *disappear*
LEVEL_545_POST_2=We'll be ready.  Let's move, Dragonsoul.
LEVEL_545_POST_3=Raah. She is not messing about. Ok, let's move!
LEVEL_548_PRE_1=There is nowhere left to run. Finally. it is time to remove the vermins of this realm.
LEVEL_548_PRE_2=Damn you, Umlaut. Do you think we will give up this easily?
LEVEL_548_PRE_3=I don't wish for it. I don't want you to give up at all. Fight. Fight until your heart is content. It makes it better for me to enjoy this moment before I defeat all of you.
LEVEL_548_PRE_4=All thou, heroes-s-s. To-night, we shall feast on thy flesh. I shall take all of thou to thy final resting place. Thou all shall not be hither to see the new realm.
LEVEL_548_PRE_5=SCREW YOU, UMLAUT.
LEVEL_548_PRE_6=From an honourable leader now fallen to a mere child. Preposterous insults. Scream in despair all you want, woman, for Sinister and I will forge a new world in fire and blood! The future of this realm will be transformed as I will use the Power of the Ancient as an instrument to purify this realm! All parasites must be cut away! 
LEVEL_548_PRE_7=Sinister, you will help me tear down the old order! Let chaos, darkness and death cleanse this realm so we can start anew.
LEVEL_548_POST_1=You pieces of retarded excrements-s-s. I'll feast on thy flesh and absorb thy souls to mine own. I am death to all. *steals the key away from Black Wing*
LEVEL_548_POST_2=UGH!  Dammit. He has the key.
LEVEL_548_POST_3=Finally. The power of kings is in my grasp. Centuries of waiting hath marshal't to this instant. Now I must bring Umlaut's soul to the souls of the damned so I can drain the last of his soul energy into my own so I can fully control the Power of the Ancients.
LEVEL_548_POST_4=You've spoken too soon, Sinister. Look behind you. 
LEVEL_548_POST_5=Umlaut?! How?? i saw thou extinguish to nothingness. How didst thou heroes know he was still alive?
LEVEL_548_POST_6=Fooled me once, shame on me? I'm sure you know the rest. 
LEVEL_548_POST_7=I've been onto you for a long time. Now, cleave unto me so you can see the joys of external darkness or I'll bring death swiftly onto thee. 
LEVEL_548_POST_8=Centuries of planning ruined in an instant. Nay. Should I canst not hast this power of the ancients then it shall be destroyed... WITH THOU, MASTER. *turns and attempt to death strike Umlaut*  *gasp*
LEVEL_548_POST_9= IMPUDENT FOOL! *grabs the Sinister Assailant by his neck* YOU DARE DEFY ME?? STRIKE ME?? *raise, squeeze* ...
LEVEL_548_POST_10=Erghh!
LEVEL_548_POST_11=OMG.
LEVEL_548_POST_12=... AND PLOT AGAINST ME, BLASPHEME-E-ER?? I AM ETERNAL. *throws the Sinister Assailant to the wall*
LEVEL_548_POST_13=*thump* Ugh! ... H-How...?
LEVEL_548_POST_14=I have known about your feeble plot since the day you eradicated the Draconians of old. Nothing goes past me unnoticed. On that day of annihilation, I could have finished you, but I've chosen to outsmart the thinker and make you do my bidding.
LEVEL_548_POST_15=Hast mercy upon me... I havst served thou majestically for centuries! 
LEVEL_548_POST_16=*laugh maniacally* Mercy? You are the traitor of all traitors. Your ambitions and evil schemes have been flawed, corrupted by the many years of over-complication. Now you will pay for your hubris, Sinister, the epithet for evil.
LEVEL_548_POST_17=Yet  thou too are evil.
LEVEL_548_POST_18=Evil? But I am not benevolent. I am simply am. And you devile cannot oppose me for I now hold your beating black heart in my hand *strike into the Sinister Assailant's chest* 
LEVEL_548_POST_19=*scream*
LEVEL_548_POST_20=... My gosh!
LEVEL_548_POST_21=Your time and life on this realm has ended. Tremble at the sounds of my breath as I, Umlaut, the bringer death to all man, beast, and creatures of the souls like you - *crack*
LEVEL_548_POST_22=ARGGHHHH EUGH-h-h-h. *collapse*
LEVEL_548_POST_23=*scream* Frigging crazy jeeez! He ripped his heart out!
LEVEL_548_POST_24=Well, daz escalated quickly. *gulp gulp*
LEVEL_548_POST_25=And if this beating cold black tar covered heart isn't proof of your evil core. *squeesh* I don't know what is... nor will.
LEVEL_548_POST_26=*long exhale with gargling sound*
LEVEL_548_POST_27=He is dead... At least that's one less evil person to worry about.
LEVEL_548_POST_28=Your lack of sentimentality is refreshing, witch. Do not think I have forgotten about you...  WHAT HAVE YOU DONE??
LEVEL_548_POST_29=Electroyeti broken the key while you were dealing with the Sinister Assailant. It's over, Umlaut!
LEVEL_548_POST_30=So dark. We've entered the DC universe. 
LEVEL_548_POST_31=Yeti!  ...  I can't complain. Great job! Almost an eye for an eye after what Umlaut did to you.
LEVEL_548_POST_32=Insolent fools. Although the key is broken and I can no longer access the Power of the Ancient... There is nowhere you can run, there is no where you can hide. Now you will face the full true naturally gifted power of Umlaut! *power surge*
LEVEL_548_POST_33=Eternal, what should we do?
LEVEL_548_POST_34=I got a plan. For now... Run toward the Tomb entrance!
LEVEL_548_POST_35= !@#$
LEVEL_551_PRE_1=BLASPHEME-E-E-ERS-S.
LEVEL_551_PRE_2= !@#$. So damn fast!
LEVEL_551_PRE_3=Pitiful vermins. I am far beyond you creatures as Sinister was beyond you. I am fire and lightning. You say I am narcissistic, but I am eternal, and I will take you to obliteration.
LEVEL_551_PRE_4=Heroes. This is the last stand. It's now or never, do or die. We must defeat Umlaut.
LEVEL_551_PRE_5=It will take all of us to defeat him. Aim for all his weaknesses.
LEVEL_551_PRE_6=But he has the power to respawn for he is immortal, how can we defeat him.
LEVEL_551_PRE_7=Not anymore. Previously, when the key was around, he was still partially connected to the Power of the Ancient. Now that the key is gone plus with the radiation from the Tomb of Ends that has the power to end ALL things, Umlaut is now mortal. 
LEVEL_551_PRE_8=That tomb is so powerful, nothing can survive in there and anything near to it will age quickly. Luckily for us, I've slowed down our body clocks to counter the effects so we can... As to how Electroyeti would say, kill that @%%#@^!
LEVEL_551_PRE_9=Hey! That's my line.
LEVEL_551_PRE_10=Pathetic. Have you not realised that I cannot be destroyed. I will show you as I will remove your souls from your body and into my own. Time to die, heroes-s-s-s.
LEVEL_551_POST_1=NOOOOOOOOOOOOO. HOW DARE YOU. I AM ETERNAL I AM POWER! NOOOOOOO!
LEVEL_551_POST_2=HOLY CRAP! So many evil spirits flying out of him.
LEVEL_551_POST_3=STAND BACK, HE IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE!
LEVEL_551_POST_4=I AM UM-M-M-M-M-LAU-U-U-U-T! BLASPHEME-E-E-ER-S-S! ARGHHH - *explode*
LEVEL_551_POST_5=*took cover* Holy molly! ... Purple lights and glitter are everywhere. Is it over...? Have we truly won?
LEVEL_551_POST_6=It's... Over. It's finally over! *raise hands to the air* The war is over! The war is over!  The war is -
LEVEL_551_POST_7=STFU, SVEN. I hate that super cringy scene. This isn't Zion. Have you forgotten that I love movies?!  I've had it. !@#$. I'm going home. I'm tired of this crap.
LEVEL_551_POST_8=Ugh. Me too. 3 years of madness. I'm going home to read some books.
LEVEL_551_POST_9=I guess I won't be bargaining with anyone today. Perhaps, I should go back and study more mystical arts.
LEVEL_551_POST_10=Sometimes, I really do think you are Mr Strange.
LEVEL_551_POST_11=Shut it.
LEVEL_551_POST_12=WTF is going on. This isn't the ending that I was expecting.
LEVEL_551_POST_13=Well, what do you want? All of us in slow motion to wake up the next morning jumping on a bed with big happy orgasmic smiles on our faces all before each of us depart one by one on a boat heading to the sunset?
LEVEL_551_POST_14=No, that's lame.
LEVEL_551_POST_15=Well, remember, we ARE Dragonsoul. It would be a waste for us to just go our separate ways now...
LEVEL_551_POST_16=(2nd & 3rd Head) Hey! We cannot separate! We want our own bodies!
LEVEL_551_POST_17=Quiet, youse!
LEVEL_551_POST_18=Hmm... Enigma Fox. How about we have a party at your palace if it's still standing?
LEVEL_551_POST_19=I think Umlaut's henchmen are still there... Want to go kick their asses?
LEVEL_551_POST_20=Sounds like a plan! I got nothing else to do. Now that my purpose is fulfilled, I feel kinda bored.
LEVEL_551_POST_21=LET'S GO BREAK SOME HEADS AND PARTY!
LEVEL_551_POST_22=This time... Yes, let's do that!
LEVEL_551_POST_23=And I'm sure there are other evil enemies out their besides Umlaut. 
LEVEL_551_POST_24=Hey! My magical ball showed me that the Belligerent  Hags are still alive and creating mischief! I guess their heads are re-attachable.
LEVEL_551_POST_25=They are still alive?!  Excellent! First, let's kick ass and party, and after that, we'll take out the hags. DRAGONSOUL, LET'S MOVE OUT!
LEVEL_551_POST_26=YEEE-YEEAAH! Party!
LEVEL_551_POST_27=Ugh. Too much cheese. !@#$ this game! Where are the credits?!
LEVEL_551_POST_28=Gosh dammit, Yeti!
