QUEST_0_1=Ugh. I've had unough. Unough, I'd say.
QUEST_0_2=*hic* E' looky we 'ave here! Ait seen ye much around.
QUEST_0_3=What do you expect? You know my skills and what I do. I do things that our Empress, Dragon Lady, would never think about doing. I do so much and yet I am still not acknowledged! Why?!
QUEST_0_4=*hic* Yer dats richt. We rarely see ye since you always fly in the sky.
QUEST_0_5=Do you think this is funny? Anger me, Ninja, and you'll soon learn that my lust for the dead can adapt to the living.
QUEST_0_6=Whoa whoa, 'ang on. Well, me dae knows how to get her attention, but its gonna cost ya.
QUEST_0_7=Marvellous! Tell me. I need to be valued in our conquest against evil, especially as it will also put me first in line to eat the corpse of the dead. Allow me to kill two birds with one stone.
QUEST_0_8=Hahaha! You like bird meat! Hahahaha! You like eatin yer brothers? Lol! *cough cough* *puff* *cough* ... *chug chug* Hahahahaha!
QUEST_0_9=*Squarrrk*
QUEST_0_10=Ow! Ma *hic* friggin ears. If you want ma help, it will cost ye 5,000 coliseum tokens.
QUEST_0_11=Are you kidding?
QUEST_0_12=Ay?! Ye think ma drinks are free or grow on trees?
QUEST_0_13=Fine!

QUEST_1_1=Nyah. 5,000 Coliseum tokens. Now tell me.
QUEST_1_2=Gwaaahaha! Lovely. Hold ma beer. *clear throat* ... To be recognised by Dragon Lady, you need to lunge at your foe with the lowest health, stun them for a couple of seconds then give them the finishing blo -
QUEST_1_3=NYAAA! DAZ WHAT I DO ANYWAY! What is diz?! Fraud. Give me my Coliseum Tokens back!
QUEST_1_4=I already spent it.
QUEST_1_5=Swine! You never moved from this spot, stop lying or I'll feast on your entra - ... Wait. Why are there several crates of beer beside you?
QUEST_1_6=Hey! You guys seem to be having fun. I somewhat heard your conversation and saw Ninja Dwarf running back and forth with lots of beer. Heh. As if you mighty warriors were having a banquet.
QUEST_1_7=I follow the Bushido! Thon is why "*hic* I can move so quickly, eavesdropper-r-r.
QUEST_1_8=Zip your lips, drunk man. Vulture, I understand your dilemma. There are only two answers to solve your case: remembering your worth or changing your appearance.
QUEST_1_9=Remember my worth? You mean, remember where I came from and how much I have grown? Don't belittle me with such hindrance. I naught 'ave to think of me past.
QUEST_1_10=As for my appearance, I am a mighty warrior. I destroy my enemies and clean up their corpses after every battle. Look at the blood stains on my body. Don't you think these stains help me stand out?
QUEST_1_11=*sigh* Watch your tone for we are trying to help you. Ahaa! How about you wear that Wicked Mullet? No, wait. How about we all wear a Wicked Mullet and pretend to be members of your Squad?
QUEST_1_12=Gwahaha! I like that. Then everyone can be a handsome guy!
QUEST_1_13=Right. It is not bad, huh? Oh, yes! *grabs Ancient Dwarf* Now we are a squad of four!
QUEST_1_14=Bwaahh. What you looking at, birdie? You wanna fight?
QUEST_1_15=Yes, so I can feast on your decaying body after when I'm through with chu-u-uu.
QUEST_1_16=No fighting, comrades. Now, hand us those Wicked Mullets, Vulture. We'll put these on and walk past Dragon Lady like a Squad. Our cool appearance and with you, Vulture, taking the lead will surely gain her attention.
QUEST_1_17=Gahaha! This is good. Fellow Dwarf, let's have a beer! *hic* Four Wicked Mullets, sitting on ya heads!
QUEST_1_18=One Wicked Mullet is enough!
QUEST_1_19=No, four. Don't forget to lead us directly in front of her.
QUEST_1_20=Stupid kids. The things you do to justify your existence.

QUEST_2_1=Idiots. Idiots! *slams Wicked Mullet on the floor* IDIOTS. I knew it was a stupid plan.
QUEST_2_2=I never imagined that she would be so expressionless.
QUEST_2_3=What did you expect? You all had just one job, but you all ruined it. Ninja Dwarf placed his hood over his Wicked Mullet, which covered it up.
QUEST_2_4=Cus I is a Ninja.
QUEST_2_5=And that action defeated the purpose of wearing a Mullet! AND YOU, you Old Fart. You put your Mullet on your stupid goat!
QUEST_2_6=How many times must I tell you, kids? Old Fart is my cousin.
QUEST_2_7=And Miss Brilliant schemer. A Wicked Mullet goes on your head, not on... "that"! You look like you got half a hairy chest.
QUEST_2_8=Sorry. Back on the island, my sisters and I never seen nor heard of a Mullet so I'd never imagined it was something you put on your head. On the bright side, it was quite warm.
QUEST_2_9=It's a wig! Even Ninja Dwarf told you how to wear it. UGH. Your stupidity is giving me flashbacks of my horrid days. My head is hurting me. *OUCH* Your stupid Goat bit me!
QUEST_2_10=Oi. Mi goat 'as feelings.
QUEST_2_11=ARGH. THAT'S IT. *walks off*
QUEST_2_12=Wait! Don't storm off in that direction, that is enemy grounds! Ancient, Ninja, follow him! He may need our help.
QUEST_2_13=I have never been so angry in my life, I'm raging. To heck with being a recognised member of the team. To heck with Dragon Lady. This migraine is giving me flashbacks.
QUEST_2_14=A headache? How about you feed me that head of yours? I'll be your headache neutraliser.
QUEST_2_15=*rushing in* Vulture, don't just storm off like tha - .... Venusia. Haven't we defeated you enough already?
QUEST_2_16=Yesterday, it was one versus fifty heroes. Now it's one versus just you guys. *deep breath* Ahhhhh. I like my odds.
QUEST_2_17=Feed me, Birdie. Feed me that female Dwarf behind you for she looks like quite a dish. Feed me that goat over there. Feed me, and I'll spare you.
QUEST_2_18=Venusia. I remember. I remember that I am Vulture Dragon! Ruler of the skies! King of all Vultures. I remember my past, and now I will use my rekindled memories to shred & leave your bloody entrails hanging from your corpse!
QUEST_2_19=Yes! Let's partner up and kick her ass, Vulture... Wait a minute, you are a King?!
QUEST_2_20=Tear me to shreds? Me? Oh, your ma-a-a-jesty. It's now time for a royal supper.

QUEST_3_1=You... dirty... Ra-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ts *croak*
QUEST_3_2=Whoa! *chug chug chug* Don't knock it. I'm sure we'll ficht against her again. These plant bosses are hard tae kill.
QUEST_3_3=Vulture. That was incredible! Your Basic Damage. Skill Power. Fury. Everything increased when you defeated Venusia! Why didn't you use this amazing skill before?
QUEST_3_4=My rage somehow caused a locked memory of mine to resurface. I remembered that Anger is one of my greatest skill.
QUEST_3_5=Using my anger gives me the ability to temporarily buff-up to extra-orbital heights. If there are several opponents clustered together or there is a strong defence line on the battlefield, I can quickly take them out.
QUEST_3_6=Then I'll name your resurfaced skill, "Death Bringer".
QUEST_3_7=And you are a King, birdie?
QUEST_3_8=Yes. Well, I use to be. Thanks to ma strength, I wus hailed King of my kind. It's a long story.
QUEST_3_9=Wow, you are almost like a different person. Now, what should we do about Dragon Lady? I can come up with a new idea if you wish?
QUEST_3_10=No thank you. I think I can get her attention myself. Something tells me that she'll be in for a big surprise.
