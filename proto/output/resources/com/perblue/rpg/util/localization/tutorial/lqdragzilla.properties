QUEST_0_1=ROOOAAAARRRRRRR!! ROOOAAAARRRRRRR!!! *Squeak*
QUEST_0_2=Ugh! Can you stop with the roaring? It's deafening.
QUEST_0_3=But did I sound great?
QUEST_0_4=No! It was incredibly annoying. You sounded like a giant rat screaming from the top of its lung whilst suffering from extreme constipation! Even Unripe is better than you!
QUEST_0_5=UGH! I will never be good compared to you. You have it all.
QUEST_0_6=I do?! Well... I do try to keep my good looks.
QUEST_0_7=You are ugly, really atrocious to look at. A kid's soul might run away from him after taking one look from you. It's so heartbreaking it's perfect. You can scare anyone without even trying!
QUEST_0_8=... King Kaiju... YOU ARE SO CRUEL! *cries* I'M GOING TO KILL YOU WHERE YOU STAND, YOU HEARTLESS FOOL!
QUEST_0_9=What do you mean?! I'm just telling you the truth! You are brilliant, I want to be just like you!
QUEST_0_10=Shut up! I want to kill you. You have no compassion nor consideration for my feelings.
QUEST_0_11=Ohhh... *speaks to himself* I forgot she doesn't like to be seen as a monster.
QUEST_0_12=What I meant to say was... You should be proud. I adore everything about you. In my heart, I want to be strong like you. Smart. Precise. Forward-thinking. Open-minded.
QUEST_0_13=Beautifully spirited on your off-days and full-on aggression with class in the line of fire. Such control and dignity in everything you do make my monster heart melt for I want to be just like you. A wonderful person-m-mean-monster.
QUEST_0_14=Kaiju... That. That was sweet. Maybe you just got a little excited earlier.
QUEST_0_15=Yeeaaah... So, will you help me?
QUEST_0_16=Yes, I'll help you! I'll make you the best monster of all the land!
QUEST_0_17=YES!
QUEST_0_18=But to that, you got to train.
QUEST_0_19=Oh... What do you have me do?
QUEST_0_20=I want you to take a team of four and go search for 7 Dragon Scales.
QUEST_0_21=7 Dragon Scales? But those are elusive! It may take me days to find it.
QUEST_0_22=Maybe
QUEST_0_23=And once I've found them?
QUEST_0_24=Once you've found them, sacrifice them.
QUEST_0_25=Are you crazy?! One doesn't just go hunting for Dragon Scales just to be sacrificed! They are worth a fortune when sold at the right market!
QUEST_0_26=Oh, so you don't want to become a great monster?
QUEST_0_27=... OK, I'll do it. I'll prove to you that I mean business.
QUEST_0_28=Good! Now give me a big almighty roar before you go!
QUEST_0_29=ROOOAAAAAR *SQUEEEEEK!*
QUEST_0_30=Ugh. J-ju-just go!
QUEST_0_31=*small scared voice* Yes ma'am.

QUEST_1_1=*panting* It... It took us a while but, we did. We.. No, I did it. I found the 7 Dragon Scales and sacrificed them.
QUEST_1_2=Yes, I can tell.
QUEST_1_3=How do you know?
QUEST_1_4=The Dragon Scale carries a rare molecule that unlocks your true inner being once inhaled. Inhaling one is harmless, but inhaling 7 does something marvellous.
QUEST_1_5=You haven't answered my question.
QUEST_1_6=Your pupils are dilated and you are panting like crazy.
QUEST_1_7=Well, you are not wrong. My day has been pretty crazy since I've come back.
QUEST_1_8=Oh?
QUEST_1_9=When I came back, I was thirsty and I needed some food. I looked at my watch, and it was 7:23 am. I thought to myself, "I never been this thirsty so early".
QUEST_1_10=So I ran to store that was 3 miles away. Got the food I wanted. I ate and paid for the food on the spot. Ran home. Crash on the sofa. Played some video games. Fell asleep. Then I woke up with a big headache.
QUEST_1_11=Well, that is not too bad...
QUEST_1_12=But then I looked at the clock and it was 7:25 am! I roared in shock!
QUEST_1_13=Haha! That is crazy! You just made me laugh. I guess you must be stronger, but we now got to bring you back to control.
QUEST_1_14=Anything! I'll do anything to get back in control. This life in the fast lane is too much.
QUEST_1_15=Anything?
QUEST_1_16=Yes. Everything I said before you sent me on that quest was true. I admired you for ages. When you defeated those enemies last month, I was so moved that I snuck away from the team to take out the enemies' boss!
QUEST_1_17=Good. Gooooood.
QUEST_1_18=So tell me. What would you like for me to do?
QUEST_1_19=Well, since you took out the enemies' boss, I believe many enemies will come hunting for me...
QUEST_1_20=... I want you to sacrifice yourself.
QUEST_1_21=That way. I can put the blame on you and distract the enemies long enough so I can destroy them when I am ready.
QUEST_1_22=*shock* Sacrifice myself?!
QUEST_1_23=Haha! Relax. I was kidding. Please, just go and sacrifice 6,000 Coliseum Token. I know those are precious to you.
QUEST_1_24=The guilt and pain you'll feel will place you in the perfect condition to gain control of your new abilities.
QUEST_1_25=I thought I was the crazy joker.
QUEST_1_26=Now go! Hurry and come back as we have one more task to do.

QUEST_2_1=Wow. I feel. Strange.
QUEST_2_2=Yes, the state you put your body in was the fastest way for you gain control of yourself and the gifts given by the 7 Dragon Scales.
QUEST_2_3=So, what now.
QUEST_2_4=Now is the time to put everything to action. We have to get you angry! We have to put your life on the line. We need to make you fight with every bit of energy you can muster.
QUEST_2_5=Yeees!!
QUEST_2_6=You need to win 45 battles against the surviving enemies!
QUEST_2_7=Noooo....!
QUEST_2_8=Don't worry. I will help you. We need to fight them anyway. It's them or us. They are holding a fight expedition to find their new champion and leader. Let's raid that expedition and take them out.
QUEST_2_9=This is crazy...!
QUEST_2_10=Those enemies ultimately serve Umlaut.
QUEST_2_11=Umlaut?! Crazy? No. This is imperative! Let's go!!

QUEST_3_1=I feel strong!! ROOOOARRR!!
QUEST_3_2=YES!
QUEST_3_3=I feel really strong. What's going on!?
QUEST_3_4=Congratulations! You are truly a monster. Look at you. Your skin is different!
QUEST_3_5=How wild!
QUEST_3_6=Indeed. Your new abilities will allow you to reduce all incoming range attacks! That is why your skin has changed!
QUEST_3_7=I feel invincible!
QUEST_3_8=Be careful. You are not impervious to everything.
QUEST_3_9=I will. Thank you so much.
QUEST_3_10=Now give me a big roar!
QUEST_3_11=ROOOOAAAAAAR!!
QUEST_3_12=YEESS! You see that? THAT is my monster.
