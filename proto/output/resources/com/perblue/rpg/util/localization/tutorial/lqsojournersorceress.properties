QUEST_0_1=Umm, I can hardly come up with a new magic.
QUEST_0_2=You cannot come up with any good idea by thinking recklessly. *pop* 
QUEST_0_3=Hey!  Do not change my flask to a macaron!
QUEST_0_4=It's okay. Don't worry. Eat some sweets and relax.
QUEST_0_5=Alright then. *munching* Oh, it's good. It's very delicious.
QUEST_0_6=Hey, Unstable Understudy, can you listen to me? *munching* I think I'm about to learn a big magic now but I haven't been able to grasp its image. *munching*
QUEST_0_7=Yeah, I get it. If you have a clear image, you can complete the magic soon. Anyway, you eat a lot!
QUEST_0_8=Why don't you eat some too? *munching* There is a variety of flavors.
QUEST_0_9=Yeah, I know.  I made them. I think that makes this witch a genius, yes?
QUEST_0_10=Maybe. *munching* Mmmm. The chocolate macaron is good too - Oh! A Chocolate Bar!
QUEST_0_11=What?!
QUEST_0_12=You know the Melty Chocolate Bars?  Now a lottery ticket comes with the bars and you can win a flask shaped as glass slippers!
QUEST_0_13=That's a super rare present. Is it a vase?
QUEST_0_14=A vase?! Whatever. Let's collect many of them before they are sold out. We need at least 50 Chocolate Bars . Help me collect them!
QUEST_0_15=Alright then. I will help you.

QUEST_1_1=Wow, we really collected 50 Melty Chocolate bars. I guess there may be more than several winning tickets in this bunch!
QUEST_1_2=Ok. Let's start opening them!  *unwrap* Lost. Lost. Lost.
QUEST_1_3=...Lost. Lost. Lost.  Oh boy... I didn't think that we would lose this much.
QUEST_1_4=Lost. Lost. Lost. L-no wait! I've won!
QUEST_1_5=How exhausting. The winning ticket appeared in the 50th bar.
QUEST_1_6=Now, the glass slippers are mine!
QUEST_1_7=Hold on. That's not a winning ticket! It's an auxiliary ticket.
QUEST_1_8=What are you saying? It's not... Oh, yes, it's an auxiliary ticket. It says that if you collect five of them, you can exchange them with a present. Darnnnnn!
QUEST_1_9=I cannot do this anymoreeee! All our efforts are in vain.
QUEST_1_10=No. I cannot let our efforts go to waste. I'm so angry! I will use this anger to create a new magic!  Arghhhh! *boom* * Crackle crackle*
QUEST_1_11=Wow, it's a big magical fire. But weren't you trying to aim at those big rock right? You didn't hit it at all. Why don't you calm down a bit so you can focus?
QUEST_1_12=I can almost grasp the image... Is there any way that I can be calm and concentrate more with my anger?
QUEST_1_13=Yes. How about drinking some milk?
QUEST_1_14=Huh?
QUEST_1_15=You know there is Mussel Milk. If you drink it, you'll be able to calm down and control your magic.
QUEST_1_16=No way. That's not gonna work... Wait. It may work.
QUEST_1_17=Of course it will work.
QUEST_1_18=It's not a bad idea to gain the calcium that I have lost throughout the years due to drinking alcohol instead of milk. Let's collect 10 bottles... No...15 bottles!
QUEST_1_19=Isn't that excessive?
QUEST_1_20=Don't care.I can use the extra bottles of milk. My grudge for the glass slippers is big!

QUEST_2_1=Collecting those Mussel Milk was not easy.
QUEST_2_2=It's not harder than collecting the Melty Chocolate Bars. We only got one auxiliary ticket.
QUEST_2_3=Ok. I've drank some of the milk and feeling a little calmer. Let's try this magic again by using those rocks over there as target practise. Here we go... Eyaaaa!  *Bom*
QUEST_2_4=That was close! It didn't hit though, You're controlling it better than before!
QUEST_2_5=Maybe I didn't drink enough milk. I'll try some more. *chug, chug, chug* Ok, here we go. Eyaaaa! *Bom*
QUEST_2_6=It hit! Honestly, I'd never imagined that drinking all that milk would make you improve this much!
QUEST_2_7=But the fire power is weak. Power means nothing if you cannot crush a rock. Maybe because I overly suppressed my anger.
QUEST_2_8=How about getting angry again?
QUEST_2_9=Well, I know, but it's not efficient if I'm angry all the time. 
QUEST_2_10=We need to change the magic.I wonder if there is any better image? I image a big fire. Like... a rain of lava.
QUEST_2_11=Ahh! A stray cat is drinking the Mussel Milk!
QUEST_2_12=Hey! This is milk so you should always keep your eyes open for stray cats. Huh? Cats? Laser Kitten!
QUEST_2_13=What?!
QUEST_2_14=To get a good image how the magic should be, let's go to an erupting volcano and shoot down a flaming boulder using a laser kitten. The visual spectacle should help! 
QUEST_2_15=I feel like I get it but not quite.
QUEST_2_16=Looks like you need some training to get your imagination going. Ok, on the first day, we'll use one Laser Kitten then increase the amount everyday. 
QUEST_2_17=I know it is difficult to control the multiple kittens from the first time, but if we are able to shoot down multiple flaming boulders at once, the spectacle will eventually burn - no pun intended - a strong image into our minds which will help me cast the magic!
QUEST_2_18=Us? This is your duty, remember? How many days will you do this?
QUEST_2_19=About four days.
QUEST_2_20=Oh boy. You should go slow. But make sure you practice that everyday, otherwise you will lose your concentration and all will be wasted.
QUEST_2_21=I know. I will hang on there. You should come and make some ice creams for me!
QUEST_2_22=Fine. I will go with you with ice creams.

QUEST_3_1=Awesome! You are using the four Laser Kitten really well and shooting down the flaming boulders!
QUEST_3_2=I'm surprised too. I've never thought that the eruption would continue for four days.
QUEST_3_3=Show me the results of your training.
QUEST_3_4=Here I go! Flame Storm!
QUEST_3_5=Wow, it's like a volcanic eruption. The fire is raining down- ouch, it's hot! Is this exactly what you imaged?
QUEST_3_6=Yessss! That's exactly what I imaged!
QUEST_3_7=The fire is a little too strong. I thought I was going to die!
QUEST_3_8=Anyway, the magic is completed. Thank you for helping me.
QUEST_3_9=Congrats! Can I treat you something with magic?
QUEST_3_10=Well, I want 31 flavors of ice creams, and four auxiliary tickets of the Chocolate Bars!
QUEST_3_11=Sometimes I really do not understand you.
