QUEST_0_1=Hey, Bone! Have you ever read the Tome of Unspeakable Hearsay? Everyone is talking about it. It just came out on the "Murky Forest Gazette's Wizards Required Reading List: Sunday Edition."
QUEST_0_2=WHAT?!? That is the most goth tome ever written! It makes fairies cry. It is why my mom kicked me out of the house!
QUEST_0_3=That book is not for *cough*... ORCS. It is for DRAGONS who understand the emotional complexity of ANGST!
QUEST_0_4=Whatever dude. I read it. It's good.
QUEST_0_5=Uuuggghh! I can't even...

QUEST_1_1=<Siiighhhhh> Now I have to find another, even more goth book. That no one has ever heard of. 
QUEST_1_2=Hey, Bone! I listened to that band Witches of Mercy you told me about. I still think Bardbarian's Barony Bards are WAY more dark. 
QUEST_1_3=WHAT?!? That's absurd! Witches of Mercy is the gothest band ever formed! They invented Necrotic Darkstep! Their lead singer Eldersign is an ACTUAL incubus!
QUEST_1_4=Bardbarian's Barony Bards aren't even goth! They are like...like...like... Norse Twilight Dance Pop or something!
QUEST_1_5=Whatever dude. Bardbarian rocks. 
QUEST_1_6=Uuuggghh! I can't even. 

QUEST_2_1=<Siiiggghhh> Who needs friends when you have artistic depth and infinite sadness. 
QUEST_2_2=Hey Bone! Check me out. I'm goth now too!
QUEST_2_3=WHAT?!?! No you aren't. You can't just decide to be goth. You aren't even dressed right. Do you even OWN eyeliner? What brand of boots are those? There is not a single buckle on them!
QUEST_2_4=Whatever Bone. I look sick. 
QUEST_2_5=Uuuggghh! That is it. I am going to show these posers what being goth is all about. It's about PAIN and SUFFERING and being in MOURNING FOR EVERYTHING!!! 

QUEST_3_1=Uuuggghhhh... I don't feel so good... that will show them!
