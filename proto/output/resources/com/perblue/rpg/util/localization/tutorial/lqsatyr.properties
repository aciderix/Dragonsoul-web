QUEST_0_1=It’s been *ages* since I've thrown a concert. How can people be happy when they don't have the gift of my music?
QUEST_0_2=The problem is Umlaut! My fans can't attend concerts when they're trying to escape a magical war zone. Live music can't thrive in this environment!
QUEST_0_3=Hey kid, who are you talking to? And you know that Bardbarian sells out shows left and right in spite of Umlaut, yeah?
QUEST_0_4=It's easy to put on a show when you have no concern for production values! An artiste like myself needs to elevate the game. My fans expect the best.
QUEST_0_5=Your f- oh, right. The 'Satyrists'.
QUEST_0_6=I have perfect pitch. Did you know that? Some people say I don't but they're liars.
QUEST_0_7=I believe you! I believe you!
QUEST_0_8=Seriously, pull a tuning fork out of my bag. You'll see. Perfect pitch. You won't believe your ears, especially if you think I'm off key.
QUEST_0_9=You carry around a bag full of tuning forks?
QUEST_0_10=Yeah. They're in my rider.
QUEST_0_11=Weird. Can I have one?
QUEST_0_12=I didn't know you sing!
QUEST_0_13=I don't. I want to juggle it with a couple of oranges.

QUEST_1_1=I'm going to put on the biggest show in the history of Draconia. They'll see the light show from freaking space. But how can I do it without roadies, backup dancers, or a manager?
QUEST_1_2=What happened to them?
QUEST_1_3=My roadies were possessed by Umlaut. My backup dancers were eaten by Cauldron Fiends. I fired my manager because he was an idiot.
QUEST_1_4=Ah. Well kid, it sounds like building your crew back up is going to take some serious cash.
QUEST_1_5=Cash! That's it! Everything gets better when you throw money at it. Do you think a million would be enough?
QUEST_1_6=Woah! Yeah, that should do it. Say... why don't you make me your new manager?
QUEST_1_7=Fine. I suppose beggars can't be choosers.
QUEST_1_8=Are there any perks?
QUEST_1_9=Of course! You get to listen to me rehearse!

QUEST_2_1=You! I gave you a million cash and the best gig you could get me was as Bardbarian's opening act?? How are we going to fit all of her fans and all of my fans in one venue?!
QUEST_2_2=Your fans will be fine. I'm sure we can find enough seats for 25 people.
QUEST_2_3=What we need to worry about right now is merchandise. Do you have anything with your face on it that we can sell?
QUEST_2_4=I have all these old Soulstones lying around.
QUEST_2_5=Considering that Umlaut is trying to collect all of our Soulstones, that sounds extremely risky... which should seriously up the market value! You're on a roll, kid!
QUEST_2_6=Wait... do you call me 'kid' because I'm half goat?
QUEST_2_7=Uh... yes?
QUEST_2_8=I feel like I should be mad, but that's a pretty good pun.

QUEST_3_1=What a fantastic show! It was thrilling! It was exhilarating! Maybe next time they'll even pay me to sing, instead of the other way round!
