QUEST_0_1=Eureka! I finally recall the legendary inscription that will grant you great power, my friend.
QUEST_0_2=By the Lords of Time, my faith in you has never faltered.
QUEST_0_3=The inscription was always on the tip of my nose; I remembered the scroll containing it excreted a foul odour.
QUEST_0_4=Excreted?
QUEST_0_5=That scroll was alive, E.
QUEST_0_6=Whenever you are in doubt, you should always trust your nose.
QUEST_0_7=And now, you have my ears.
QUEST_0_8=The inscription said: Whosoever seeking for true power must climb to the top of the mountain before dawn,
QUEST_0_9=chant the words, "Bezabume-ah-ah-BUU", while possessing the Fight Tokens,
QUEST_0_10=then prepare thyself to receive the power of Time Surge.
QUEST_0_11=Preposterous! Surely this must be a joke? I will not do it!
QUEST_0_12=You doubt my words?
QUEST_0_13=I doubt that scroll.
QUEST_0_14=If you don't want the power, then perhaps someone else mig...
QUEST_0_15=My apologies, I will try. Anything to help our quest.

QUEST_1_1=Do you feel that, my friend?
QUEST_1_2=Incredible! I feel...
QUEST_1_3=That you can manipulate space and time?
QUEST_1_4=Ye-yes!
QUEST_1_5=Excellent. The steps you have taken will bring you closer to unleashing something new.
QUEST_1_6=I never dreamed that I could attain such power.
QUEST_1_7=That means you are incomplete. Remember, Feeling and Performing is two different things. If you become complacent, you'll perish.
QUEST_1_8=Incomplete? I feel great!
QUEST_1_9=Come. We must rage battles in the exhibition halls. We must go to the Hell Grounds of Mordak.
QUEST_1_10=Mordak. Smelt for miles that place contains a putrid smell of rotten fallen warriors.
QUEST_1_11=Its non-scalable, tall, jagged, beaten by weapons and bathed with blood walls, serve as a grandstand to the most repulsive of evil dwellers.
QUEST_1_12=You look horrified.
QUEST_1_13=It's a Labyrinth that descends deep into the ground, into a forbidden region that never seen sunlight, and demons lie in wait for their next victim.
QUEST_1_14=Twice we went there, both times by force. We fought and barely escaped with our lives. Now you want us to go back?
QUEST_1_15=It's folly to think we can succeed. It's not possible.
QUEST_1_16=No, my friend. For your sake, it's necessary.

QUEST_2_1=Incredible. You were amazing.
QUEST_2_2=*panting* But something is wrong. I cannot control the power.
QUEST_2_3=Then we have no choice. You need to make a sacrifice?
QUEST_2_4=A sacrifice?! Surely one of your scrolls contain the answer to this problem?
QUEST_2_5=Let it go. Answers are no longer inside scrolls and books!
QUEST_2_6=Tell me... What must I do?
QUEST_2_7=You must sacrifice your precious Laser Kitten.
QUEST_2_8=Laser Kitten?! *sigh... That, I can do.
QUEST_2_9=For 5 days straight.
QUEST_2_10=That, I cannot do!
QUEST_2_11=Then go home to mommy.
QUEST_2_12=I am not a coward!!
QUEST_2_13=Then make the sacrifice.
QUEST_2_14=It will be done.

QUEST_3_1=I-I-Incredible! I can see it! Control it. T-This new power intertwines with every fibre of my being.
QUEST_3_2=They say that time kills everything, but I feel it has no bearing on me. Magnificent!
