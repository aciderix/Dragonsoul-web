QUEST_0_1=I have appealed to Drathor the Dragon Titan to restore my throne and my flesh.
QUEST_0_2=Flesh! Flesh!
QUEST_0_3=Calm down, faithful Squire. Alas, the Titan demands penance for my prior arrogance. Personally, I think he's being overly sensitive, but no matter.
QUEST_0_4=He has ordered me to demonstrate both patience and humility by sacrificing one Lavishly Adorned Rapier.
QUEST_0_5=Patience and humility. Hmph. I'm really too important to waste my time on this nonsense.
QUEST_0_6=Patience bitter but fruit sweet!
QUEST_0_7=...What even goes on in that decomposing head of yours?

QUEST_1_1=Apparently my sacrifices were not enough for Drathor the Dragon Titan. Dragon Titan? More like Naggin' Titan! Right?
QUEST_1_2=...
QUEST_1_3=Yes, well. Drathor is now demanding that I sacrifice my body in combat. I must engage in 30 Hard mode Expedition battles alongside a dragon, to demonstrate brotherhood with the draconic race.
QUEST_1_4=Fire pony! Fire pony!
QUEST_1_5=Yes, I suppose dragons basically are fire ponies. Never thought about it that way before- no, Squire! Fire pony friend! No eating!

QUEST_2_1=Surely Drathor the Dragon Titan will be satisfied now. Soon my curse shall be lifted...
QUEST_2_2=Humbug! That faithless Titan now tells me that he will never lift the curse, for "I have learned a lesson more valuable than gold and thrones." Well I've got a lesson for him! Squire, attend!
QUEST_2_3=Bring me the ancient blade of my ancestors, imbued with mighty magic and wreathed in legend!
QUEST_2_4=McEpicPants! McEpicPants!
QUEST_2_5=None other! They say don't bring a sword to a gunfight. Well, I'm bringing both!
QUEST_2_6=Do not hurt pony titan!
QUEST_2_7=Now, to reclaim my throne and end the titan's meddling forever. The story books shall remember my name for centuries: Skeleton King, Ponyslayer- er, Dragonslayer!

QUEST_3_1=Okay, so apparently you shouldn't try to fight a Dragon Titan. Got it. Good to know. Now, to bandage up what's left of my ribs...
