QUEST_0_1=Shagga norei hatha Krytho sa'gru char-ei thola mehet sulla- oh, it's you.
QUEST_0_2=Hiya. Whatcha doin'?
QUEST_0_3=I was *attempting* to contact Krythos, the Ghost Titan. His horrifying specter stands like a sentinel of death between the real world and the eternal torments of the ethereal-
QUEST_0_4=Oh yeah, Krythos. Green, translucent, glowy red eyes? Cool guy. Very terrifying.
QUEST_0_5=You know Krythos?! How did a neophyte like you ever contact the Ghost Titan??
QUEST_0_6=Well for starters, I didn't sit in a salt circle in the middle of the woods and chant mumbo jumbo. You've gotta go right to the source. Get yourself a copy of the Necronomicon.
QUEST_0_7=But that nefarious tome has been lost for thousands of years!
QUEST_0_8=Sorry, didn't realize your name was Defeatist Witch. Your problem is, you're too hung up on 'incantations'. You need to start focusing on the 'in-CAN-tations'.
QUEST_0_9=Oof.
QUEST_0_10=Let me clue you in on a secret: you don't even really need the whole book. Just gather up a couple dozen or so pages to show Krythos you mean business.
QUEST_0_11=What do I do with the pages once I have them?
QUEST_0_12=Idunno. Do you know origami?

QUEST_1_1=I can feel the power flowing from these pages, as if each word were an unholy enchantment-
QUEST_1_2=I made a swan!
QUEST_1_3=*sigh* What is the next step to contacting Krythos?
QUEST_1_4=Check it. Krythos loves spirits, obviously. But he HATES reanimated corpses. They go against his whole aesthetic. Zombies, skeletons, can't stand 'em. He really appreciates it when people wipe out the walking dead for him.
QUEST_1_5=Before the moon sets tonight, I shall descend to the Crypts and destroy every monster I see!
QUEST_1_6=Can I give you a little word of advice? I know you're excited to meet Krythos and everything, but you're coming across kind of thirsty. Just saying.

QUEST_2_1=No matter what I try, I feel no closer to contacting the Ghost Titan. I fear I shall never find a way to imbue my specters with the power of ultimate horror.
QUEST_2_2=Wait, that's what all this was about? You want to make your ghosts scarier?
QUEST_2_3=I'm not sure why it matters to you, but my goal is-
QUEST_2_4=ALAKAZAM!
QUEST_2_5=AGH! What is this I feel flowing through my veins? It is as if my blood has been replaced with liquid fear! I AM THE MOST TERRIFYING OF THEM ALL!!!
QUEST_2_6=Yeah, that spell's easy. Just ask next time. Oh, but you're gonna want to burn off some of the excess energy or it'll melt your brain. I'd go fire off a few of those ghosts before it's too late.
QUEST_2_7=You've given me the power I have sought for so long. I don't know how to repay you.
QUEST_2_8=And you taught me that sharing is fun! We're basically best friends now.
QUEST_2_9=What? No we're-
QUEST_2_10=Yes, we are. Bye-ee!
QUEST_2_11=Imagine that nonsense. Me, with a friend. Hah. *sniffle*

QUEST_3_1=There is nothing to fear but fear itself. In other news, I'm considering getting 'Fear Itself' tattooed on my bicep.
