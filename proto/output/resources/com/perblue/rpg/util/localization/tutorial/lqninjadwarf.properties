QUEST_0_1=Ya, know, I think I might be a mite bit thirsty, ken?
QUEST_0_2=I don't know if that is such a good idea.
QUEST_0_3=Just a wee beverage break, I promise. I think a hundred Goblin Grog will do the trick. That'll be just enough to wet mah whistle.

QUEST_1_1=Ah! Refreshin'!
QUEST_1_2=Hey Jiggles, maybe you should take a break on the hooch.
QUEST_1_3=*Hic*, I dunno what yer *hic* talkin' bout Horsey Man.
QUEST_1_4=Uh, seriously. I think you need to take it easy.

QUEST_2_1=Wow, ok. Color me surprised.
QUEST_2_2=*Hic*, I told ya. No one ken match mah *hic* stamina.
QUEST_2_3=Now, let's get down ta business. Mah grog. Where's mah grog?!
QUEST_2_4=Look Jiggles, I know you proved yourself by defeating all those Titans, but seriously, the last fight was embarrassing. Snoring is not allowed on the battlefield!
QUEST_2_5=Ye think yer so big 'n tough? Fine! I'll go ta yer house to get it back meself!

QUEST_3_1=Forty five bottles of grog on tha wall, forty five bottles of grog, lalalalala-
