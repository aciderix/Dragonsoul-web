QUEST_0_1=It appears to be a simple archaic oil lamp, yet when friction is applied-
QUEST_0_2=BEHOLD!
QUEST_0_3=-that happens.
QUEST_0_4=Tell me your heart's desire, my narrow, pasty friend. But be warned! For the gifts of the mighty genie come with terribly ironic consequences-
QUEST_0_5=I have no 'desires' per se, aside from an intellectual curiosity with regards to the functionality of your lamp.
QUEST_0_6=You must phrase your request in the form of a wish! It's in the by-laws!
QUEST_0_7=I will humor your semantic exactitude. I wish to know how your lamp works.
QUEST_0_8=To learn the mysteries of the lamp, you must pay the genie's price, and the genie's price is power! Lay before me a pile of Artifacts of Unimaginable Power, and the secret shall be yours! HAHAHAHAHA!
QUEST_0_9=I do not get impatient, but this had better be a VERY fascinating lamp.

QUEST_1_1=In summary: you are able to fit into the lamp because it is magical and when you enter it you, quote, 'Get real small'.
QUEST_1_2=You do not seem overwhelmed with the awesome power of the lamp!
QUEST_1_3=You are quite perceptive.
QUEST_1_4=If you aren't satisfied with your wish, I don't get my bonus! Wish for something else!
QUEST_1_5=My time is not without limits. Dragon Lady is leading the company in the Fight Pit tournament this week, and I wish to participate-
QUEST_1_6=I heard the word 'wish'! You can't take it back! BEHOLD! If you bring the genie a golden trophy, he will make you the mightiest Pit Fighter in the land!
QUEST_1_7=Ah, I see your ruse. If I earn the trophy, I will already be a champion Pit Fighter. So it will appear that you have granted my wish but I will have done all the work.
QUEST_1_8=What did I say? Perceptive! Now get cracking, sucker!

QUEST_2_1=I have come to a conclusion. You are actually entirely incompetent when it comes to granting wishes. Your only actual ability is to inexplicably create barnyard animals.
QUEST_2_2=BEHOLD!
QUEST_2_3=I see you have conjured a goat from thin air. While impressive, it does speak to my point.
QUEST_2_4=I cannot help it! My natural pheromones attract them from miles away! I have to do something with them!
QUEST_2_5=Logically, if one has a surplus of farm animals, the natural solution would be to start a farm.
QUEST_2_6=But this is a war goat! Unsuited to the tranquility of domestication! See as he runs to and fro, bashing things with his horny head!
QUEST_2_7=If we were to unleash these beasts in battle, they might provide a needed advantage against the forces of Umlaut.
QUEST_2_8=...

QUEST_3_1=...
