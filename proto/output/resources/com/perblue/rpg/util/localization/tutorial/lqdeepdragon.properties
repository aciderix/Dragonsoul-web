QUEST_0_1=Hey buddy, why so blue?
QUEST_0_2=Both my parents were blue.
QUEST_0_3=Let me back that one up and try it again. Hey buddy, why so glum?
QUEST_0_4=No one understands me. There's no way they can comprehend the pain that lives in my... dragon soul.
QUEST_0_5=Wow.
QUEST_0_6=I've been working on a new book of poems. The theme is "The Darkness".
QUEST_0_7=Naturally.
QUEST_0_8=But I've lost my favorite pen! It's like it was a part of me. The words just flowed out.
QUEST_0_9=Maybe we can find you a new one. What kind of pen was it?
QUEST_0_10=A liche finger dipped in hydra venom.
QUEST_0_11=A WHAT DIPPED IN WHAT?!

QUEST_1_1=I'm experimenting with new forms of poetic expression. Maybe "books" and "paper" and "ink" are just chains imprisoning my words, you know?
QUEST_1_2=Hmm. You could try spoken word. Or chiseling things into stone tablets. Ooo, or skywriting!
QUEST_1_3=I've heard of this "Global Chat" thing. Not exactly sure how it works, but it may be the future of short-form writing.
QUEST_1_4=That's a fascinating idea! Spend a few days putting poetry in there and see what comes out.
QUEST_1_5=Then it's settled. I'll write the word POETRY in the Global Chat for five days.
QUEST_1_6=That wasn't what I... you know what? Go for it.
QUEST_1_7=(It can't be any worse than his actual poetry.)
QUEST_1_8=What was that?
QUEST_1_9=Oh, uh... I sneezed.
QUEST_1_10=Maybe you have some kind of wasting disease? That would be sublime.
QUEST_1_11=Gee, thanks.

QUEST_2_1=I've decided short-form poetry isn't for me. How can I possibly express the darkness within me in single words and emoticons?
QUEST_2_2=That's too bad.
QUEST_2_3=What was that?
QUEST_2_4=I mean, oh, that's sad.
QUEST_2_5=Exactly! I knew you got me. Your ears shall be the first to hear my newest poem, "Death, Death, Poor Dragon". The-
QUEST_2_6=No, wait! Ugh... surely I am unworthy of such an honor. You know, no wasting disease or anything.
QUEST_2_7=I suppose you're right, but who do you suggest?
QUEST_2_8=Ah. Right. Oh, I know! There's loads of undead things in the Crypt! That would be the perfect place- everyone in there has a thorough appreciation of death, I'm sure!
QUEST_2_9=That's a brilliant idea! I shall defeat my enemies in the Crypt, and then give them the pleasure of my newest poem!
QUEST_2_10=(Whew, just barely pulled *that* one out of the fire!)

QUEST_3_1=Who knew defeated enemies make the best audience? They go so still, I know they're listening with their souls... I'm sure their bleeding wounds have nothing to do with it.
