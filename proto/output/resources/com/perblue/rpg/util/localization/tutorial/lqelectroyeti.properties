QUEST_0_1=I'm always gettin' in trouble for @#$%% cursing.
QUEST_0_2=Maybe if you start doing it to, I won't seem so bad!
QUEST_0_3=Let's try it. Type "!@#$" every day into chat for the next five days.

QUEST_1_1=Electroyeti!
QUEST_1_2=@$%! What is it now?
QUEST_1_3=How dare you corrupt the player like this! I am very disappointed in you.
QUEST_1_4=It's not my @%%^#$ fault!
QUEST_1_5=You have to make up for it. A Boss Pit fight should do the trick.
QUEST_1_6=Oh for- just give me a @$%%^^&#$ break.
QUEST_1_7=No way mister. Defeat Venusia on Really Freakin' Hard and we can consider your penance partially paid.

QUEST_2_1=Ok, I've defeated that @%%%%@^ flower. Happy now?
QUEST_2_2=Not quite.
QUEST_2_3=Are you @%%#@^ kidding me?!
QUEST_2_4=You should be happy to be getting off so lightly! Your last penance for your potty mouth is....you have to do 1 million damage in a single day.
QUEST_2_5=FINE.

QUEST_3_1=All right. We're good.
QUEST_3_2=About @%%^#@ time!
