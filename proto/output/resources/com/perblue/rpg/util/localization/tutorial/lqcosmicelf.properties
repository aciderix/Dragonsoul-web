QUEST_0_1=Conventions are by far the best way to spend the weekend.
QUEST_0_2=I agree! I'm so excited to be immersed in all things CosmicCon.
QUEST_0_3=Affirmative. It will be the most logical use of 40 Laser Pointers I have had in months.

QUEST_1_1=Oh! Oh! There's a "How to Self Publish Your Dragon Fanfic" panel at 11!
QUEST_1_2=Excuse me, a what?
QUEST_1_3=Um..Nothing.
QUEST_1_4=It's almost 11! I have to...be somewhere else.
QUEST_1_5=I will stay here. I wish to watch the Cosplay.
QUEST_1_6=Hey man, me and 6 of my buddies think your Cosplay is rubbish.
QUEST_1_7=I can only assume that you have not mistaken my normal attire as a Cosplay and are, instead, insulting me.
QUEST_1_8=That about sums it up.
QUEST_1_9=Then the next logical step is to teach you and your 6 friends a lesson in the Titan Temple.

QUEST_2_1=That panel, was amazing! Why are you covered in blood?
QUEST_2_2=It is not important.
QUEST_2_3=Drat! I was going to ask Willowtree Wilson a question at this panel but the queue is already out of control!
QUEST_2_4=Do not lose heart, my friend. I will Silence 200 of these enemies and you will be the only logical choice.

QUEST_3_1=That was so thoughtful.
QUEST_3_2=You are and will always be, my friend.
