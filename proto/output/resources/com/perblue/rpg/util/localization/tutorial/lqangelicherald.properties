QUEST_0_1=Laaaaaaaaa!
QUEST_0_2=That voice. That pitch. It's so heavenly to my ears. Who is making such a beautiful sound?
QUEST_0_3=Oh. Can I help you?
QUEST_0_4=Ah. So, it is you that possess the power to capture my heart with your heavenly voice. I felt something deep inside me awoke when you were practising your chores.
QUEST_0_5=Why thank you. I didn't know I'd move you so much. Right now, I am practising for my concert. I got quite an audience tonight.
QUEST_0_6=Please. I must hear your divine voice once more before departing.
QUEST_0_7=*clears throat* La-la-laaaaa!
QUEST_0_8=I felt it again. This power. I-I don't understand. Why is that?
QUEST_0_9=Wow. I didn't realise that I figuratively ignited something within you.
QUEST_0_10=Not figuratively, literally.
QUEST_0_11=Literally?
QUEST_0_12=Yes, literally. There is no mistaking it. Your voice is not only the key to my heart but the key to unearthing a greater power deep inside me. I... No, we must unlock it. Will you help me?
QUEST_0_13=Hmm. I do sense something powerful inside you. Do you think you have that Legendary power nonsense inside you? Electroyeti thought he had something, but it was gas.
QUEST_0_14=Nonsense? So far, several of our comrades including Raging Revenant possess some extraordinary power. I'm positive this is my calling.
QUEST_0_15=Ok. I will help you. For 5,000 Guild Tokens.
QUEST_0_16=5,000 Guild Tokens?!
QUEST_0_17=A gurl gotta eat!
QUEST_0_18=No problem, I'll be right back. Please, do not go anywhere.

QUEST_1_1=There, as promised. 5,000 Guild Tokens.
QUEST_1_2=Fantastic. Hold on. Done. I just made an online order.
QUEST_1_3=Great. So, when will we start?
QUEST_1_4=Wait. While you were gone, Triple Threat destroyed three of my Motivational Cassettes. I needed those cassettes to prepare for my concert!
QUEST_1_5=How did he destroyed your cassettes?
QUEST_1_6=He listened to three cassettes at the same time...
QUEST_1_7=Three at the same time?! How did he... Oh. Of course.
QUEST_1_8=Then, as if he was at a rave, he got overly excited and breathed fire everywhere. The big brute realised he melted the cassettes when it stopped playing.
QUEST_1_9=How reckless. We must tell him to get new ones for you.
QUEST_1_10=There is no time! I want you to go out and find new ones for me instead. I need three. Do you understand? Three!
QUEST_1_11=Huh? But Triple Threat was the one that...
QUEST_1_12=LISTEN, PRETTY BOY. I NEED THREE! *sigh* I have no time to bicker, do you want new powers or not?
QUEST_1_13=I-I never wanted to trouble you.
QUEST_1_14=Don't you know how hard it is to maintain excellence once you are at the top? The fans love me for my pitch perfect voice. Look. I still have the tuning fork Centaur gave me when I performed at Draconia.
QUEST_1_15=You don't know the things I must do to stay at the top. Ugh. Hey. If you never disturbed me this morning, this chain of events would never happen.
QUEST_1_16=You are so angry. Please calm down.
QUEST_1_17=*Throws flute* FIND THEM.
QUEST_1_18=OK! Gosh. I never knew she had such a temper.

QUEST_2_1=*panting* Here are the three Motivational Cassettes you requested. I searched far and wide, narrowly avoided getting struck by lightning, but I did it.
QUEST_2_2=Oh. Triple Threat returned my cassettes, he mistook them for his own. He is also sad because he destroyed his favorite Motivational Cassette containing a song called, "Fire Starter". No wonder he acted as if he were at a rave earlier.
QUEST_2_3=Huh?!
QUEST_2_4=Silly. Also, how could you rush out hunting for new Motivational Cassettes for me but never ask what type of Motivational Cassettes I require?
QUEST_2_5=... *growl*
QUEST_2_6=Hold on. *Put her hand on Angelic Herald's chest* LAAAAAAAAAA!
QUEST_2_7=WHOAAAA. My chest is glowing! What did you do?!
QUEST_2_8=When you were out, I spoke with Triple Threat and Magic Dragon about your condition. They said your case sounded the same as another Angel they befriended a long time ago.
QUEST_2_9=They also told me what she did to awaken her power. I tried the same method on you. I think it worked.
QUEST_2_10=The connection between my Father and I feel stronger than before.
QUEST_2_11=Come! We must unleash your true strength by fighting at the Exhibition.
QUEST_2_12=The Exhibition? Us? How many enemy teams must we defeat?
QUEST_2_13=Well, the other Angel was close to death before wielding her new power. I'd say defeating over 30 teams will do. Defeating 20 teams was your previous best, no? Don't worry, I will help.
QUEST_2_14=Are you insane?! And what about your concert?
QUEST_2_15=Screw my concert. I want to see that new power of yours.

QUEST_3_1=OMG OMG. The Exhibition was such a rush! Tell me, how do you feel?
QUEST_3_2=I feel complete! More than great! The connection between my Father and I is now stronger than ever.
QUEST_3_3=In the name of heaven, I'll call this new power, "Heaven's Rays". *Blows trumpet*
QUEST_3_4=It's beautiful! It's - Ah, I feel stronger! My energy. Skill. Nothing can stop me! OMG. I'm - I'm going to start a new concert. With this buff, I'll be unstoppable!
QUEST_3_5=Wait! This buff is temporary!
QUEST_3_6=My legion of fans, sorry for the delay. Your perfect singer is now coming to give you a performance of a lifetime! I'm going to sing and kick all the enemy bosses' butt at the same time!
QUEST_3_7=WAIT-T-T-T. I SAID IT'S TEMPORARY. TEMPORARY-Y-Y-Y. Oh my.
