QUEST_0_1=You're unusually quiet today. Is something wrong?
QUEST_0_2=I'm just trying to figure out how to talk to my pups about Umlaut. How can I tell them there's someone out there with so much evil in them? How can I tell them they need to be good dogs when he sets an example like that?
QUEST_0_3=Wow, that's really rough.
QUEST_0_4=You did not just make a 'ruff' pun.
QUEST_0_5=Maybe a little. But I know this is serious. Hey, besides you, nobody loves those pups more than me!
QUEST_0_6=I've actually started teaching them to fight. They need survival skills if they're going to make it in this crazy world. Unfortunately they're little pups, which means their brains are y'know, little.
QUEST_0_7=Make sure you teach them that tail chasing thing you do. It turns the bad guys to confetti.
QUEST_0_8=I tried to teach them but they can't run in circles. We've managed some straight lines, a couple figure eights, and my oldest keeps running in trapezoids.
QUEST_0_9=Ooh, I know. Laser Pointers! Shine them in circles. Your pups will catch on really quick.
QUEST_0_10=That's perfect! If we have to turn our babies into bad guy killing machines, at least they can be synchronized.

QUEST_1_1=Have you ever heard of "Weaponized Cuteness"?
QUEST_1_2=That sounds awful. Imagine, something being so cute it's deadly!
QUEST_1_3=Cute things shouldn't be fighting, they should be frolicking and nuzzling things with their cold noses and getting into adorable mischief!
QUEST_1_4=I agree! It's just something I heard Umlaut is working on. He's running some kind of experiment on a phantom of Moon Drake over near Drakewise Tower.
QUEST_1_5=Why Moon Drake?
QUEST_1_6=Well, because she's the cutest in the land, of course.
QUEST_1_7=Where is this phantom?! THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE! YAAAAAAH!!!
QUEST_1_8=Wait! Don't run off without a full party... too late. That dog is long gone.
QUEST_1_9=...Doggone. Heh.

QUEST_2_1=My pups are really tearing things up. But something's missing: it isn't enough that they know how to hurt people. They need to be able to help them, too.
QUEST_2_2=You've been talking about needing a good example, but I think you're the good example, Unicorgi! Get out there and use your healing powers! Show them the good they can do!
QUEST_2_3=You're right! Thanks so much, Understudy. I really appreciate all this advice.
QUEST_2_4=Glad I can help. Now all you need is an injured person to demonstrate your healing on.
QUEST_2_5=Hey, thanks for volunteering!\nYou're the best.
QUEST_2_6=...Meep.

QUEST_3_1=All parents should teach this lesson to their children: when you're done running in circles, remember to use the rainbow that comes out of your horn to magically heal injuries. It's the new Golden Rule.
