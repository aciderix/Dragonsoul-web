QUEST_0_1=I don't know how to put this delicately. Magic Dragon has some serious hoarding issues.
QUEST_0_2=I think it might be a deep-seeded dragon thing. He tries to fight it, but his tower just fills up with piles of kitsch.
QUEST_0_3=His latest obsession is those pony keychains.
QUEST_0_4=Do you think you could spare 25 of those? He'd be really pleased!

QUEST_1_1=How did you know I collected these?
QUEST_1_2=This is the most thoughtful gift I have received in some time!
QUEST_1_3=I know just the place for them too! If you'll excuse me, I need to go to my tower straight away!
QUEST_1_4=Well that went well!
QUEST_1_5=Okay. Now he'll want to create a giant pile of stuff to accent his pony collection.
QUEST_1_6=Head to the shops and buy...oh...a hundred or so items. Doesn't matter what it is, he's just going to throw it all together.

QUEST_2_1=Oh this is perfect! Let's go take it to him right now!
QUEST_2_2=Look at all this beautiful junk! I am overwhelmed by your generosity.
QUEST_2_3=I'm so glad you like it, sir!
QUEST_2_4=I am elated. So much in fact, I could jump for joy. I think I'll put this energy to good use and try to dodge attacks 100 times in combat!

QUEST_3_1=Those are some nimble feet!
QUEST_3_2=I feel like I'm 300 again! It has really put a spring in my step.
