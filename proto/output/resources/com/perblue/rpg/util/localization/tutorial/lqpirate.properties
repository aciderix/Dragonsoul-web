QUEST_0_1=Blow me down! Shiver me timbers! Avast and batten the hempen mains'-
QUEST_0_2=Whoah whoah whoah, calm down. What's happening?
QUEST_0_3=The legend'ry ghost ship, the Triton's Fury, has been espied off the Bleached Coast!
QUEST_0_4=Seriously? Does it contain fabulous riches??
QUEST_0_5=Nay, just fabulous ghosts. But I wants it all the same! Quick, I must get a message to all me old hearties! Find me 100 bottles of Mussel Milk, as fast as ye can!

QUEST_1_1=Stand clear! Like a fell ghost, that Mussel Milk is comin' back to haunt me!
QUEST_1_2=What? You drank *all* of it? Why didn't you just pour it out? Whatever. Let’s start writing messages to put in the bottles. Ugh, this is going to take forever.
QUEST_1_3=Nay, me hearties and me have a secret code - short and sweet it is! Write YARR! on each slip of parchment. They'll understand, and come runnin'!
QUEST_1_4=Maybe we should just write YARR! in the chat for five days? It'll save time and paper.

QUEST_2_1=Alright, your crew is assembled. Off to find the Triton's Fury! Do you have any idea where it went after it left the Bleached Coast?
QUEST_2_2=Not even a scrap!
QUEST_2_3=Darn. Alright, well, we need to search for it. Let's start gathering supplies.
QUEST_2_4=Yar, just dig out what we need from me pile o' Plunder!
QUEST_2_5=Wow, you have one of just about everything in here! I'd poke through it but I'm afraid I'd get tetanus. Maybe we should just bundle it up and take the whole thing.
QUEST_2_6=That ship's so close I can smell it! Wait, that's just me. Arr, still exciting!

QUEST_3_1=Mine! Mine at last! Triton's Fury and its ghostly guns, all at the command of Captain Rot Beard! Yar har har har har!
