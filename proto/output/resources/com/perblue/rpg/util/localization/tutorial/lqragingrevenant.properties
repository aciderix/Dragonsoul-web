QUEST_0_1=*slams empty glass on table* Ahhh! Then, the mistress hath given me another drinketh, which I've accepted, but then she screamed at me to cease wetting myself after I tooketh a sip.
QUEST_0_2=So I toldeth that lady, "Woman! What doth thee expect?! I am a ghost!"
QUEST_0_3=Haha! You always were a joker.
QUEST_0_4=But I wasn't joking. What was the lady thinking? I AM a ghost!
QUEST_0_5=Yes, and you are wetting the floor right now. But, lucky for you, you have a very understanding little brother. *sip* Mmmm... This is good Chardonnay.
QUEST_0_6=... Ugh. This is awful! I wanteth to drinketh and receiveth malt-worm like everyone else. Pretending to drinketh just to see the beverage falleth right through mine Ectoplasm body and splash onto the floor?! Disgraceful.
QUEST_0_7=I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!
QUEST_0_8=Whoa! Calm down, big brother. It's just a drink. You do not want to destroy this bar, do you? After you destroyed the last place, this is the next best bar we've found for miles!
QUEST_0_9=ARGHHHH!! I has't no body! Wherefore doth I bother followeth thee to bar at which hour I cannot enjoy a drinketh?! And behold at those folk!
QUEST_0_10=Behold who??
QUEST_0_11=Those folks art laughing at me.
QUEST_0_12=.... Now listen here. No one is laughing at yo..
QUEST_0_13=Death cometh for all in darkness and gloom. I'm going to killeth everyone hither, killeth all in this room! Ugh! No more. I wilt killeth everyone hither right now!!
QUEST_0_14=Calm down! Err... Waitress! I'd like to pay our tab now. *put gold coins on table* Big Brother, come with me outside before you destroy this place.
QUEST_0_15=Everyone must kicketh the bucket!! No one knoweth mine thousand years of pain! Mine power useth to knoweth no bounds!
QUEST_0_16=Thousand years? Ahh, that's it!! Big brother! Come with me, I may have a solution for you. *both walk outside*
QUEST_0_17=Ugh. It's cold out hither.
QUEST_0_18=... Listen. This is the solution. It won't allow you drink away your sorrows but I've figured out something better. Let's unlock your true power.
QUEST_0_19=Mine true power?
QUEST_0_20=Yes. Unlock your true power. As your said, you use to be powerful. I believe your true power really has been sealed away a thousand years ago.
QUEST_0_21=I believe if you unlock that power then you would be able to drink and destroy your enemies easily! You'll be drunk with power.
QUEST_0_22=Malt-worm with power? Thee meanteth, Megalomaniac?
QUEST_0_23=Who cares about the definition! Point is, once we've unlocked your true power, you will be in control and powerful enough to take on anyone.
QUEST_0_24=Guuuuuud. I wanteth everyone to feeleth mine power. Telleth me what I needeth to doth.
QUEST_0_25=Give me a minute to think. Surprising or not, my ol'noggin contains a wealth of knowledge that would bring Magic Dragon to shame.
QUEST_0_26=Hurry. Or thee too wilt soon feeleth mine wrath.
QUEST_0_27=Patience, brother. Ok. This is a three step process but I believe this method may work for you as it worked for my great demon uncle, Stanley.
QUEST_0_28=Demon uncle?
QUEST_0_29=Nevermind! Listen. First, you must obtain and sacrifice four Liche Fingers.
QUEST_0_30=Thee mean that rotten digit that doth smell like it hath been stuck up the buttocks of some dragon for centuries?
QUEST_0_31=Disgusting. I certainly wouldn't describe it like that but... yes. That finger.
QUEST_0_32=Beest sure thee art correct about this, friend. Mine high patience but tis apace wearing thin.
QUEST_0_33=*sigh* Let's go. It shouldn't be far from the terrains we've already passed.

QUEST_1_1=Ugh! It stinks!
QUEST_1_2=Relax!
QUEST_1_3=Mine hands stinks! Doth something, friend! Thee art mine friend... right?
QUEST_1_4=Friend? I'm your brother.
QUEST_1_5=Thee art not mine real brother! Not by blood.
QUEST_1_6=Stop pretending. You are a ghost, remember? You cannot drink, feel the cold, nor smell anything. We may not be brothers by blood, but we are brothers till the end and I am all you've got.
QUEST_1_7=Now what? What say thee?
QUEST_1_8=This is a three parts process, remember? Sacrificing those Liche Fingers triggered something deep inside you. Now, we need to spark it alight and harness it.
QUEST_1_9=Let's go to the expeditions and fight many as 30 warriors. While you are fighting, I'll be close-by casting an enchantment that should help you.
QUEST_1_10=Valorous. The enemies of these lands should falleth victim to mine blade. Cometh! We must flee to the expeditions, taketh down mine enemies, and trample on their flesh in glory. May those fifths tremble in fear.
QUEST_1_11=*shakes head* Maybe you are drunk.. Alright, let's go...

QUEST_2_1=Power! Rage! It flows through me! Arrrrghhhhh!
QUEST_2_2=Whoa! I never expected this, brother! You are changing into different colours, giving off so much heat like a sauna, and generating lots of wind! It's like you are controlling nature!
QUEST_2_3=Three sun align with all and bright, may feeleth mine sword pierce through with MIGHT!
QUEST_2_4=What the #$%*?! You are now inside a small tornado!
QUEST_2_5=By my enemies' hands by craft and art, but what wast one I'll TEAR APART!
QUEST_2_6=This is insane, brother! Stop talking gibberish! You are acting like you are possessed but how can a ghost be possessed?!
QUEST_2_7=Help me, little brother, or kicketh the bucket whither thee standeth!!
QUEST_2_8=I'm sorry, but you need to stay like this for the next 5 days!
QUEST_2_9=WHAAAAAAT?!
QUEST_2_10=*shouting* Listen to me brotherrr!! For 5 consecutive daysss, youuu must sacrifice a jar of Kitten Tearrrs. When you've done that, you'll retain controool! Brotherrrr? CAN YOU HEAR MEEEEE!?
QUEST_2_11=5 DAYS?! Thee tricked me! I'll killeth thee!! I'll killeth everyone! I'll destroy this world!!
QUEST_2_12=Listennn! Just sacrifice those Kitten Tearrrs! Now. *Skeleton King fix his clothing* I'm not going to hang around here for 5 days with all this wind and heat.
QUEST_2_13=Brother! I'm going to check out this new Arcade, grab some food and hang out with Spirit Wolf. She is making a new cake for tonight's party, it should be swell!
QUEST_2_14=ARGHHHH! Thee filthy RAT!!
QUEST_2_15=Think logical, brother! Why should I stay here for 5 days?! You are a big man, you'll will be fine! J-just kill those tears. Gotta dash.
QUEST_2_16=ARGHHHH! I'LL KILLL YO...
QUEST_2_17=I CAN'T HEAR YOU WITH ALL THIS WIND! BYEEEEE!!!! I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF THE GAME IS GOoood.... *gone*
QUEST_2_18=ARGHHHH! Whither art those Kitten Tears?! I'll sacrifice'em then destroy the world! ... *sniff* ... I want to go toilet.

QUEST_3_1=Big brother. I'm back. The party wasn't bad so you didn't miss much, but... WHOA!! Bro!
QUEST_3_2=Didst thee cameth to gloat?
QUEST_3_3=I can feel it. You are powerful! I cannot believe it worked!
QUEST_3_4=Aye. I sense most wondrous strength flowing through me. I nev'r suspected that it would be this immense. What doth thee mean thee cannot believeth tis hath worked? What about thy uncle?
QUEST_3_5=Uncle? Oh, I just made that up to encourage you, but who cares! Your vitality, strength, power. Everything about you increased! You are powerful and... in control! I am so proud.
QUEST_3_6=In control? Wherefore doth I compose thy words art taunting me? Eke, despite this power, I still cannot drinketh.
QUEST_3_7=.... Here. Eat and drink this. I took them from the party.
QUEST_3_8=Thee art playing with me. I has't no time for such pedantic.
QUEST_3_9=No, do it. I have a feeling that you'll be surprised.
QUEST_3_10=Fine. *eats & drink* Huhh?! I can taste it. Feel it. I-I'm not wetting myself!
QUEST_3_11=Yes!!
QUEST_3_12=But how?
QUEST_3_13=Your unlocked power. In order for it to work, it had to partially solidify your Ectoplasm body and your power will burn whatever you put into your stomach.
QUEST_3_14=So, not only you are powerful but you can eat & drink like the rest of us!
QUEST_3_15=Fascinating. Little brother. Thee art more mischievous than I've ever imagine.
QUEST_3_16=Let's go, big brother. The next drink at the bar is on me!
