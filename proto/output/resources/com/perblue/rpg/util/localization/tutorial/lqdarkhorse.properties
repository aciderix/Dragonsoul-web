QUEST_0_1=The state of our company is pitiable, if you don't mind my saying so.
QUEST_0_2=No, I love it when people bluntly criticize my leadership skills.
QUEST_0_3=Excellent. For example: look at everyone just sitting around.
QUEST_0_4=You mean resting?
QUEST_0_5=Exactly. They've got no verve. I want to see them chomping at the bit for some battle!
QUEST_0_6=What exactly do you suggest?
QUEST_0_7=First we need to provide them with the proper motivation. Let's play one of those Motivational Cassettes. That'll get them on their feet.
QUEST_0_8=Who is it who records those things, anyway?
QUEST_0_9=Perhaps you could use those leadership skills to find out.
QUEST_0_10=You're insufferable, do you know that?
QUEST_0_11=I've heard that, sure.

QUEST_1_1=Now we have the gusto we need to take the fight to the enemy!
QUEST_1_2=I'll grant you, it was a good idea.
QUEST_1_3=I have so many more good ideas!
QUEST_1_4=Hooray.
QUEST_1_5=We have to spur these sorry saps into action. I say, run them through the Fight Pit until every last one of them is a lethal weapon. If they can produce six thousand Fight Pit Tokens, that would indicate that they're on the right track.
QUEST_1_6="Spur", "track", "chomping at the bit"... do you do that intentionally?
QUEST_1_7=Do what?

QUEST_2_1=And look at this equipment! Training with this garbage is like beating a dead horse.
QUEST_2_2=Okay, that one had to be intentional!
QUEST_2_3=We need to throw it all out. Let's start with this Crude Shield. This thing couldn't stop a poorly worded insult.
QUEST_2_4=Equipping quality gear is the first step on the path to victory, I always say.
QUEST_2_5=You've never said that!
QUEST_2_6=I say it under my breath. Being quiet is the second key to victory. I always say that too.

QUEST_3_1=As a reward for my contributions, Dragon Lady has promoted me to Cavalry Commander. I know I'm the only horse on the team. Doesn’t matter. I'm going to lord it over everyone anyway.
