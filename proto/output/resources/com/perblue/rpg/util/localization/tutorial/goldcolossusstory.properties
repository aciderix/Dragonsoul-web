STAGE_1_PRE_1=Why did the spell transport us here? I don't like this.
STAGE_1_PRE_2=So...I'm guessing...Trap?
STAGE_1_PRE_3=Totally a trap.
STAGE_1_PRE_4=Indeed.
STAGE_1_PRE_5=@$*#! What is that thing?!
STAGE_1_PRE_6=Oi! How are we gonna even get to it! I'm gettin' blown all over tha place!

STAGE_1_POST_1=Alright you golden geek, time to tell us why we've been led here!
STAGE_1_POST_2=I think I'll exit gracefully, instead. Until we meet again!
STAGE_1_POST_3=Oi! What the?! Where did he go?
STAGE_1_POST_4=Hmm. He left runes burnt into the ground...

STAGE_2_PRE_1=Where are we this time?
STAGE_2_PRE_2=I see you got my message.
STAGE_2_PRE_3=You #@%!! I'll show you!
STAGE_2_PRE_4=Uh, Fuzzball...the ground is...
STAGE_2_PRE_5=OWWW! Spikey @%$ @#%^$ bones!!! Sizzlin' sonnofa $#@%^ my FEET!!!
STAGE_2_PRE_6=You're welcome to come after me, if you don't mind bloody soles.
STAGE_2_PRE_7=Awww man! This is gonna hurt, isn't it?

STAGE_2_POST_1=Pant...pant...We've got you now!
STAGE_2_POST_2=Sorry to disappoint, but our merry chase must continue!
STAGE_2_POST_3=Come back, you coward!
STAGE_2_POST_4=Ok, that's it! I'm going to see if I can figure out a counter-spell for that obnoxious teleport of his.
STAGE_2_POST_5=There's more runes on the ground, kiddo. I'll get everyone's feet wrapped up while you get ingredients.

STAGE_3_PRE_1=You got that counter-spell ready, kiddo?
STAGE_3_PRE_2=I think so. He shouldn't be able to escape this time!
STAGE_3_PRE_3=Time to sizzle this @#%!

STAGE_3_POST_1=What have you done? I can't teleport!
STAGE_3_POST_2=Now that we have your attention, time to answer some questions.
STAGE_3_POST_3=Why did you lure us to fight you?
STAGE_3_POST_4=This world was ours, and Umlaut said he was going to help us get it back. I've been tricked.
STAGE_3_POST_5=Oi! Whatchu talkin' about, goldie locks?
STAGE_3_POST_6=It doesn't matter. I'm done for.
STAGE_3_POST_7=Wait! Do you mean there's more of you?
STAGE_3_POST_8=The statues are the key...Please don't let him wake any more of my brethren...we're just being used by him!
STAGE_3_POST_9=We'll stop him, we promise!
