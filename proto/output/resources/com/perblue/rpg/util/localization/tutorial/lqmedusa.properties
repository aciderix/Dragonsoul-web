QUEST_0_1=Medusa has a test for you, but refuses to tell you about it. She says it's beneath her.
QUEST_0_2=So she sent me here to tell you that 'only those who worship the full moon will be granted' her legendary skill.
QUEST_0_3=Self absorbed, nasty, snake-haired witch....

QUEST_1_1=Hooray! You've passed the first test.
QUEST_1_2=Sigh...
QUEST_1_3=Yup, you guessed it. She won't even come out and say thank you.
QUEST_1_4=Now she and I are even! Next time she tries to save my life, I'm just going to tell her to let me die. Nothing is worth this.
QUEST_1_5=I'll take it from here Centaur.
QUEST_1_6=Medusa has another test for you.
QUEST_1_7=She heard that eating raw eggs makes your hair shiny and lustrous.
QUEST_1_8=She thinks about one hundred eggs should yield some results.

QUEST_2_1=Okay, so...it didn't make her hair look any better.
QUEST_2_2=Fortunately, snakes LOVE raw eggs.
QUEST_2_3=So she's...not happy. I've never seen her happy.
QUEST_2_4=She's slightly less pissed off than normal. Well done!
QUEST_2_5=I heard that you cretin!
QUEST_2_6=Now, time for my final test!
QUEST_2_7=We don't spend nearly enough time in the Crypts.
QUEST_2_8=I demand that we beat five lineups in one day. And they need to be tough enemies, too.
QUEST_2_9=Let's say....20,000 power or higher.

QUEST_3_1=Excellent! You have passed all of my tests!
QUEST_3_2=Perhaps you are not as pathetic as I thought.
