NOTICE_CLOSET=Whoa! I never noticed this before...
ARROW_TO_CAVE=Looks like some kind of cave. And that glow looks MAGICAL!
OPENED_MYSTIC_CLOSET=Wow, there are neatly arranged rows of...costumes?! What kind of deranged wizard...
DIALOGUE_1=Hmm, this is actually quite amazing: You can change the appearance of your heroes here. That's some powerful magic!
ARROW_TO_SCROLL=Hey, let's find me! I could use a new haircut, I'm sick of this dorky bob.
ARROW_TO_UNDERSTUDY=Ooh, let's see that Mastery Skin!
TAP_FOR_MASTERY_SKIN=That's more like it! I've finally let my hair down. Hehe.
TAP_TO_CONTINUE=Now you need to promote me to purple and complete a quest to unlock this skin. What are you waiting for? Let's go!
WRONG_HERO_SELECTED=I know this is magic and all, but that's a little out of my element...
