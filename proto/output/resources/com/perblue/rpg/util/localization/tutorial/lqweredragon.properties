QUEST_0_1=UGH. I want to be strong! Triple Threat! I need your help!
QUEST_0_2=What is this?! A small half-breed dragon?
QUEST_0_3=Do not belittle me, but you are right. Yes, I am a half-breed dragon but that is irrelevant. I want to become stronger, strong as a full-breed dragon! Can you help me?
QUEST_0_4=(2nd Head) Blah! Why should we help this, ha-a-a-lf-bre-e-ed? He looks kinda tasty... LET'S EAT HIM.
QUEST_0_5=WAIT. DON'T EAT ME.
QUEST_0_6=QUIET, YOU. Stupid second head. We should be more courteous to our guest. If he upsets us then he will become our new dish. After all, we have never eaten a half-breed before.
QUEST_0_7=(2nd Head) Yeeees-s-s-s.
QUEST_0_8=Please. I'll give you anything you want. I just want to be strong so I can help you and the other heroes.
QUEST_0_9=Ok, half-breed. I see your spirit. Let's do this, step by step.
QUEST_0_10=First. Bring me 5 Overpowering Fragrances.
QUEST_0_11=Overpowering Fragrances? What do you want with those?
QUEST_0_12=Overpowering Fragrances are necessary for you to receive the strength of a true Dragon, but why you questioning instead of taking action?
QUEST_0_13=Don't try to waste my time or kiss that strength and your life goodbye, half-breed..
QUEST_0_14=Alright! I will bring the Overpowering Fragrances. Once I bring them, please show me how to gain true strength like a full-breed dragon!
QUEST_0_15=(2nd Head) HEY. Watcha tone, ha-a-a-alf bre-e-e-e-d.

QUEST_1_1=Sorry, I kept you waiting! I collected the Overpowering Fragrances. All 5 of them, as you've requested.
QUEST_1_2=Half-breed, I was growing tired waiting for you. Give them to me.
QUEST_1_3=(2nd Head) Gu-u-u-u-ud. Gu-u-u-u-ud. Now, let's eat him.
QUEST_1_4=(3rd Head) Ahhhhh. Why eat his body when we can suck out his sou-u-u-u-l?
QUEST_1_5=Hold your tongues. Why you are both fascinated about death and souls is beyond me. Thank goodness that I am the main head.
QUEST_1_6=(3rd Head) *cackle*
QUEST_1_7=*click* *sniff* Mmm.... Ahh, yes. This is the stuff.
QUEST_1_8=Whoa. For some reason, it's making your body glow and... I-I don't know why, but it's making you look magiciently elegant.
QUEST_1_9=Go-o-od! I am pleased that you recognise my power and understand how wonderful I am. However, I am the king of many mountains so I'm disappointed that you never recognised this sooner.
QUEST_1_10=Err... So-o-o-o. Is the smell the key for me to become stronger?
QUEST_1_11=No. You just ran an errand for me; I got date tonight and no woman likes a stinky dragon.  Now. You did say you would do anything to become stronger, did you not?
QUEST_1_12=It was just an errand?!
QUEST_1_13=(2nd Head) Frustration frustration! I sense his frustration! Let's eat 'im! EAT 'IM.
QUEST_1_14=NO NO. I WASN'T FRUSTRATED. Just surprised.
QUEST_1_15=I like you, half breed, Your real challenge starts now.
QUEST_1_16=To find true strength you must first "build" it! Come. We'll go to the Great Hall of Mordak and defeat over 30 enemies. There, you must kill and dare never to resist.
QUEST_1_17=30?!
QUEST_1_18=(3rd Head) WEAKLING. WE ARE WASTING OUR TIME. LET'S SUCK HIS SOU-U-U-L.
QUEST_1_19=QUIET.
QUEST_1_20=... but he does have a point, half-breed. Is that fear I hear in your voice? Do not disappoint me by having miserable battles. Embarrass me, then unfortunate for you, I will grant my brothers their wish.
QUEST_1_21=(2nd & 3rd Head) *evil death stare*
QUEST_1_22=N-No no. No problem. Let's go to Mordak.
QUEST_1_23=Heed my words... My breath brought death to all that stood before me, half-breed. Find your strength quickly so death won't come seeking for you.

QUEST_2_1=*Wheezing* I... I'm dying. I have no breath left.
QUEST_2_2=You have survived the battle grounds of Mordak. You've impressed me, half-breed.
QUEST_2_3=I... I don't feel any stronger. My energy is spent.
QUEST_2_4=Here. Listen to this Motivational Tape that I've borrowed from Angelic Herald. It should help you ease your body, and quickly replenish your energy.
QUEST_2_5=Motivational Tape? Thank you so much. I don't know how this will work but... *click* OH CRAP.
QUEST_2_6=(2nd & 3rd Head) AHHHH. HE BURNT IT. HE BURNT IT.
QUEST_2_7=I'M SORRY.
QUEST_2_8=FO-O-O-OL. ANGELIC HERALD WILL BE FU-UURIOUS.
QUEST_2_9=(2nd Head) KILL 'IM.
QUEST_2_10=OH GOSH, I'M SO SORRY.
QUEST_2_11=*thinking* Hmm... He is lucky that tape was not mine but now we'll have to do this the harder way.
QUEST_2_12=YOU VEX ME, HALF-BREED. IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE AND WANT TO BE STRONG, BRING ME 30 OF YOUR SOULSTONES.
QUEST_2_13=My-my soulstones?! But I need them for our battle against the Dark Lord, Umlaut.
QUEST_2_14=YOU DARE-E-E QUESTION ME-E-E? I AM WIND... AND FIRE. NO SWORD CAN PENETRATE ME, NO POWER CAN SCRATCH MY SKIN. *deep voice* I bring death to all-l-l including dra-a-a-gons.
QUEST_2_15=(2nd Head) YE-E-E-E-EH. KILL 'IM, KILL 'IM.
QUEST_2_16=(3rd Head) *sadistic laughter* Ahhhh-hahahahaha!
QUEST_2_17=*shaking* No-no-no problem! I will get you my soul stones.
QUEST_2_18=Oh boy...

QUEST_3_1=There you are. My soulstones, as requested.
QUEST_3_2=Good.
QUEST_3_3=I really want to be stronger. Surely, everything I've done up to now proved that?
QUEST_3_4=Then, let's proceed. Half-bre-e-e-e-d.
QUEST_3_5=(2nd Head) *crunch crunch*
QUEST_3_6=Argh! You crunching the soulstones in your mouth?! But, why? A-are they edible?
QUEST_3_7=*muffled* quiet. I need to concentrate for this stuff taste revolting. *power surge*
QUEST_3_8=Whoa. What is that light coming from your mouth?
QUEST_3_9=(2nd Head) *Power surge* *huff*
QUEST_3_10=Why are you taking such a deep breath? W-What are you planning to - ARGHHHHH. WHY BURN ME?? ARGHHHHHH.
QUEST_3_11=*breath out blue fire*
QUEST_3_12=ARGHHHHHHhhhh... aaah... Ahh... Ah. Huh?! The blue flames doesn't hurt at all. I feel different. Stronger. ... What's going on?!
QUEST_3_13=Behold. You now possess real strength like a true dragon.
QUEST_3_14=*change into a dragon*
QUEST_3_15=(3rd Head) *shock* ACK.
QUEST_3_16=My magic and fire damage attack. I.. I can cause damage to nearby enemies with my explosion. *turns back to human form* ... My HP recovery. My strength. It's incredible!
QUEST_3_17=How did you know?!
QUEST_3_18=I know more than your feeble mind can dream. I know magic, rituals and legendary arts that no hero can ever comprehend.
QUEST_3_19=Thank you! I am most grateful. Now I can be more useful to everyone including you.
QUEST_3_20=(2nd Head) Great. Now, let's eat him!
QUEST_3_21=*Change to Dragon*
QUEST_3_22=(3rd Head) Err.. Let's not.
