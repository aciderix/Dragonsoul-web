QUEST_0_1=I'm ready to start making your new quiver.
QUEST_0_2=Sick. Can you put a picture of me holding the quiver *on* the quiver? In gemstones or golden thread or something? Don't forget the mullet!
QUEST_0_3=Um, yeah, so, I need to talk to you about that...
QUEST_0_4=You look afraid. I've never seen you look afraid.
QUEST_0_5=Here's the thing: to get the kind of bulk arrow storage you're looking for, I need the strongest thread in the world. To get the kind of style you're looking for, I need the prettiest thread in the world.
QUEST_0_6=Oh no. You don't mean-
QUEST_0_7=I'm going to need that Wicked Mullet of yours, my friend.
QUEST_0_8=Oh! Thank goodness. I thought you meant my luxurious chest hair. I have a spare Wicked Mullet anyway. Go ahead and take it.
QUEST_0_9=Why do you have an extra head of hair?!
QUEST_0_10=So I can see what it looks like when I'm not near a mirror. Don't judge me.

QUEST_1_1=So where should we test out this quiver prototype?
QUEST_1_2=You could use some stone imps for target practice. They don't feel pain anyway.
QUEST_1_3=Meh. I want a real challenge - something Really Freakin' Hard. The hardest target for the best archer in the world!
QUEST_1_4=Technically Dwarven Archer is the best in the world. She won that medal-
QUEST_1_5=SHE CHEATED.
QUEST_1_6=Okay, well, I heard that creepy old wizard is hanging around again, so we'll have to chase him off at some point.
QUEST_1_7=Who, Invokus? That's perfect! I'll put an arrow right through his hood.
QUEST_1_8=What will that accomplish?
QUEST_1_9=It'll look funny, for starters.

QUEST_2_1=The quiver is almost done. Now we need to test capacity.
QUEST_2_2=How many arrows does it hold?
QUEST_2_3=As many as there are stars in the sky.
QUEST_2_4=Ooh! How many is that?
QUEST_2_5=600.
QUEST_2_6=You just made that number up.
QUEST_2_7=Prove it.
QUEST_2_8=Well... you got me there.

QUEST_3_1=Style. Flavor. Unlimited arrows. Your boy just leveled up.
