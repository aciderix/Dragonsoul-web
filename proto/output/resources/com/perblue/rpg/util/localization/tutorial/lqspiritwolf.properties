QUEST_0_1=HEY!! LET ME OUT OF THIS CELL!!!
QUEST_0_2=Stupid, awful, tacky dressed, thrift store, tag poppin' guards! No one throws BABY in the dungeon!! I didn't do anything anyway. Those skirts called to me. They were in pain. That store owner didn't even have them on a flattering mannequin. It's not stealing when the clothes psychically ask to come home with you!
QUEST_0_3=There is no way this wolf in this dress (that cost a literal Wagon of Diamonds, BeeTeeDubs) is sleeping on a floor that smells like... <sniff>... <sniff>... Yup, that's totally Bardbarian pee.
QUEST_0_4=...Huh?
QUEST_0_5=Nevermind. Go back to dreaming about sweaty men with tribal tattoos.
QUEST_0_6=Mmmmm tribal... 
QUEST_0_7=Gross, Bard... Gross.
QUEST_0_8=Ok, time to skedaddle... I knew that 800 Freeman's Crowbars stuffed in a girl's handbag would come in useful some day. This should get the dungeon door open and me on my merry way.

QUEST_1_1=Jailbreak, check! On to more freaking awesome adventuring. My life is so AhhhhMAZING. 
QUEST_1_2=They should put me in a reality show: "Real Spirit Wolves of Pirate Port"! SNAP, everyone would watch that! I need to call my agent...
QUEST_1_3=<WHOOP><WHOOP> I think we found her, Captain. Spirit Wolf! Hold it right there. You are under arrest!
QUEST_1_4=...
QUEST_1_5=You know, I was just thinking it might be time for a little vacation from all this adventuring. Maybe lie low for a bit until no one is looking for me. 
QUEST_1_6=Five days away from everything should be enough time for things to cool down... Oh, and relax up so I can to get back to questing for the good of the realm, of course. 

QUEST_2_1=Ok, it's official. Vacation is like eight flavors of MEH. Besides, when I'm alone in this cave, who's going to compliment me on these fetch pumps I ordered from Dragonzon. Spoiler alert... NOBODY! 
QUEST_2_2=I think it's about time to make my re-entrance. But how am I going to be able to live YOLO when everyone is out hunting wolf?
QUEST_2_3=What am I talking about? I've got the skills to make haters forget. I'm going to Mesmerize them all... or at least two hundred or so! That should be enough cover anyone who's ever seen me do anything "illegal"!
QUEST_2_4=Maybe...

QUEST_3_1=Hey Spirit Wolf! Where ya been? It's great to see you!
QUEST_3_2=A little Forget-Me-Now spell works every time! <wink>
