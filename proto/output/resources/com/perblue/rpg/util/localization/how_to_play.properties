WAR_CARD_3_BULLET_2_TITLE=Matchmaking
WAR_CARD_3_BULLET_2_TEXT=When a Guild Leader, Champion, or Officer starts a battle, your Guild is immediately matched against another Guild based on your Guild's Rank at the start of the War.

WAR_CARD_4_TITLE=Fighting a Battle
WAR_CARD_4_BULLET_1_TITLE=The War Map
WAR_CARD_4_BULLET_1_TEXT=Once you're in a Battle you can see the defending Guild laid out on the War Map. The most powerful enemies are on the left, weakest on the right. The number of shields shows how many defending lineups an enemy has left.
WAR_CARD_4_BULLET_2_TITLE=Attacks
WAR_CARD_4_BULLET_2_TEXT=Each Guild member has 3 attacks to deploy per Battle. Each enemy on the map has 3 defending lineups, worth progressively more Battle Points. Defeating a lineup adds that number of Battle Points to your Guild's score for the Battle.

WAR_CARD_4_BULLET_4_TITLE=Your Heroes
WAR_CARD_4_BULLET_4_TEXT=Choose your Heroes wisely: they will be able to charge energy during the first Minion wave and use their skills against the defending Heroes. Like the Crypt, once a Hero fights, it is considered 'Used' and out of the Battle. Also, you can't hire Mercenaries in War.
WAR_CARD_4_BULLET_5_TITLE=Defending Minions
WAR_CARD_4_BULLET_5_TEXT=These foes are chosen randomly at the beginning of each War. All Guilds have the exact same Minions for an entire War. However, Minion power does vary based on the power of the defending Heroes. Once killed, defending Minions do not respawn.
WAR_CARD_4_BULLET_6_TITLE=Defending Heroes
WAR_CARD_4_BULLET_6_TEXT=Like Minions, defending Heroes who are not defeated in Battle retain both their health and energy. As a rule, it is always best to win a Fight on the first attempt because 1) you get to charge energy against Minions and 2) defending heroes have no energy to use their skills. 
WAR_CARD_4_BULLET_7_TITLE=Fight Rewards
WAR_CARD_4_BULLET_7_TEXT=In addition to earning Battle Points from a successful Fight, you also earn gold and contribution.

WAR_CARD_5_TITLE=Defending Against Another Guild
WAR_CARD_5_BULLET_1_TITLE=War is Attack-Focused
WAR_CARD_5_BULLET_1_TEXT=Guild War emphasizes attacking. This is because head-to-head Guild matchups will often be unfair. Although defending is secondary, it definitely impacts your overall War rank.
WAR_CARD_5_BULLET_2_TITLE=Setting Defenses
WAR_CARD_5_BULLET_2_TEXT=Tap the Defense button on the War Map screen to set your 3 defensive lineups. You must have these lineups set to be eligible for a Battle. Note that your 3rd lineup is worth the most points.

WAR_CARD_5_BULLET_3_TEXT=If another Guild is matched against yours, they fight a Battle against you. Based on the Battle's outcome, your Guild's Crown count will adjust up or down. If one of your specific lineups is attacked, you will receive a Message with the outcome and rewards.
WAR_CARD_5_BULLET_4_TITLE=Defensive Rewards
WAR_CARD_5_BULLET_4_TEXT=Your Guild scores normal Battle rewards for a successful Defense (i.e. the attacking Guild fails to earn enough of available Battle Points). Individual members also earn contribution for every defending lineup that has not been defeated.
WAR_CARD_5_BULLET_5_TITLE=Opting Out of War
WAR_CARD_5_BULLET_5_TEXT=If you don't want to participate in War for whatever reason, you can opt out from the "Defense" screen. Just tap the button and confirm to be removed from War. While opted out you won't be able to participate in current or future Battles on either offense or defense. You can opt back into War at any time, even in the same week. Once opted in, you will be excluded from the same number of Defensive Battles as Offensive Battles that you were opted out of in the current War Week.
