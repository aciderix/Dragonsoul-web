QUEST_0_1=Check this out! We found these scrolls - apparently you used to be able change the power of other heroes!
QUEST_0_2=Really? I don't really see the point, but it could be entertaining. How do I do it?
QUEST_0_3=The Titans posess unique modified powers, perhaps if you could slay one you could gain some insights into them.

QUEST_1_1=There. EZ PZ. But... I don't really feel like I learned anything.
QUEST_1_2=Hmmmm. The Sven's Sword of Doom items littered across the land have some of your power in them. Maybe you could extract it!
QUEST_1_3=Are you seriously giving ME a fetch quest?
QUEST_1_4=No... think of it as a gather and destroy quest!
QUEST_2_1=Don't you feel powerful now?
QUEST_2_2=Not really, I mean... I set the drop rate for those things to be pretty high, so...
QUEST_2_3=Ok whatever. All Legendary Quests have three steps, so for the last step go kill a bunch of enemies with DOOOOOM!
QUEST_3_1=I remember now! I can change anybody's stats with a glance! Let's go nerf some heroes! Everyone will hate that!
