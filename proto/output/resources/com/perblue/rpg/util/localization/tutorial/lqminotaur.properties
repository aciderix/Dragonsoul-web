QUEST_0_1=BRO, DUDE!!
QUEST_0_2=Dude, bro??
QUEST_0_3=Thanks for asking! He's here, bro. That nutcase who locked me in that labyrinth? He's somewhere here in Draconia!
QUEST_0_4=That's intense! What are we gonna do, bro?
QUEST_0_5=We gotta find him, we gotta give him a sternly worded lecture, and we gotta stomp him! Preferably in that order!
QUEST_0_6=But Megabro, how will we find him? The world has like, *all* the hiding places in it. He could be anywhere!
QUEST_0_7=We need to get the power of wisdom on our side. Let's gather up thirty-two of those Magic Eight Balls. They just KNOW stuff, dude.
QUEST_0_8=Why thirty-two?
QUEST_0_9=Think about it. There are two of us, we both have two hands, and it's a magic EIGHT ball. Two times two times eight is thirty-two. That's math! Math is science, and science is power!
QUEST_0_10=POWER, BRO!

QUEST_1_1=Got some intel on our guy. They call him the Maze Weaver. Get this: Master Thief told me that Boxer Dwarf heard from Gnomewrecker that Digger Mole's cousin got hired to help him dig a new labyrinth! The jerk is doing it again!
QUEST_1_2=People in this kingdom give their kids such stupid names. I'm glad my mom didn't do that.
QUEST_1_3=How is Momzerker, anyway?
QUEST_1_4=Good! Still taking those community college courses.
QUEST_1_5=Sick. But that's enough talk! We gotta flip our switches from 'Chilling' to 'Vengeance', dude!
QUEST_1_6=My switch is flipped, bro! Where do we find this creep?
QUEST_1_7=They're digging near the Lost City. We gotta go on an Expedition!
QUEST_1_8=Do you know what that means?!
QUEST_1_9=HARDCORE BATTLE MONTAGE, BRO!

QUEST_2_1=We gotta find this jerk before he finishes his new labyrinth. Those places are a nightmare. Do you have any idea how many people I had to eat when I was down there?
QUEST_2_2=Wow bro, it must have been like... fifty-three.
QUEST_2_3=Wha- that's *exactly* right.
QUEST_2_4=Got As on all my papers in school. My nickname was Guessbro.
QUEST_2_5=Nice. Alright buddy, get pumped! We got a maze to punch!
QUEST_2_6=YEAH BOYYY! Wait, can you punch a maze? What's our plan here?
QUEST_2_7=Maze Weaver hired that giant idiot Aurum to guard his dig site. We fight him, beat him, he falls over and crushes the whole operation. We're gonna punch that maze with his big gold butt!
QUEST_2_8=Pretty soon my new nickname's gonna be Punchgold Buttmaze!
QUEST_2_9=That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard and I love it! You're the only one who gets my sense of humor! Let's go bro!
QUEST_2_10=Bro!
QUEST_2_11=BROOO!!!

QUEST_3_1=We smashed the labyrinth but Maze Weaver escaped. He can tell the whole world as he runs away crying: you build a weird creepy maze thing, you're gonna get punched by some SERIOUS BROS!
